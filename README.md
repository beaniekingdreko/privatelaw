# Uniform Private Law 
Introduction: the globalization 
Send our opinions, information all around the world makes the world so tiny that we have to consider ourselves belonging to the same society. Geopolitically it started with the European unification. with continuously wider competences and increasing number of members after the fall of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989 and continued with the open policy of China sanctioned by its adhesion to the WTO in 2001.
In this context there are legal systems, they are set of social rules applied in a certain community. It could be simple (family) or complex, we can have many legal systems at the same time. In Italy we have two legal systems at the same time, catholic and govern.

Legal System and definition of law
A legal system is a set of rules applied in a certain community. They can be very simple or very complex, and there may coexist more than one legal system. For example, in the only USA, there are both federal and states law; in addition there is the UCC legal system, the uniform commercial code, which promotes a set of rules that unifies the USA in different matters of the commercial sector. Even if its not binding it can be considered as a legal system, and once adopted by the parties of the contract its mandatory for them to follow it.
There is even the legal system related to the personal status: if for instance a person is catholic, it means that he will follow the rules of the catholic community to marry or bury someone. Traditional legal systems are related geographically to a country. Non-national legal systems are instead related to communities (ex. Lex Mercatoria); they’re based on the rules they create for themselves.
We can attend to unify all social systems as state, religion, moral rules.
Law is the product of societies; they’re expressing themselves and their identity. 
Is product of the experience of these people, historical event of the community. Then there are social and economic factors, but also mentality, ideology exactly as each of us has its own identity made by his/her mentality, religion, ethics… the same is also for legal systems.
We don’t consider law just as product of a public authority, law is everywhere. Rules are produced by communities, societies. They express the identity of this society and community that has created rules. The language plays an important role. In every interrelation between humans, language is important, could be also just body language. In some situations, body language is important in legal perspective. It could also be misunderstood. Language is used in a different way where legal system is based on written rules or customary law, the way civil and common law countries express their rules is different, because in the history, the development of the legal system was in the common law tradition more oral, while in the civil law was written.
Social Rules System Theory
Legal systems are sets of rules. Among these rules there are also social rules, that are non-binding rules applied in a certain community – e.g., institutions, norms, laws, statutes, regulations, but also customs and religion beliefs, taboos, values and miscellaneous concepts-.
Ontologically every rule is produced by a community, a society and in this respect is a social rule. All the rules that are created from a society through their public authorities or spontaneously but created inside a community, by the interaction by human beings are social rules and among social rules we can distinguish formal and informal rules.






Formal v. Informal Rules
•	Formal rules are found in sacred books, legal codes, handbooks of rules and regulations, or in the design of organizations or technologies that a dominant authority (ex. Parliament) seeks to impose in a particular social setting. There are formal rules in the Constitution as in sacred books.
•	Informal rules appear less “legislated” and more “spontaneous” than formal rules, they are generated and reproduced in ongoing daily interactions. They continuously change forward; they are not as binding as legislative rules, but they deal with the real life. This is also the uniform law is created. (ex. of informal rules: gift-giving and playing poker with friends)

Formal diverges from informal rules at the point that there may be conflicts between the two. Studies have demonstrated that official formal rules are not always those operating in practice. In some cases, the informal unwritten rules not only contradict formal rules, but they lead over them under some conditions. Application and implementation happen through processors of meaning, of interpretation and of adaptation. When someone violates a nonbinding social rule, usually there isn’t s a sanction but there’s an impact on the reputation of who had a wrong behavior. 

Community as a legislator
We, as members of the community, produce social rules or give them social force every time we act in their compliant. Sometimes, we do not even realize to be part of this rules production. These kind of production of rules is important to understand how uniform rules are implemented in private law.

Meta Legal Data and Legal Data
Meta legal data are All factors that haven’t a legal content but influences directly or indirectly the legal process. The legal process is the creation of rules in every form. We can refer to it as the context or as laws in action. 
Legal data Is any data of the legal nature coming directly or indirectly from authorities recognized by the community as having a role in the legal process (public or private authorities). 
The difference is that speaking of meta data are not produced by authorities. An authority could also be a private association as the ISDA (private association).
We can also say that the difference between the two is that the meta legal data is the context while legal data is the text. the text are the rules.
Example 
Text: statues, constitutions 
Context: history, language
Agents
Meta Legal Data
The legal process is a very long process; it does not involve just institutions, but everyone; it is ontologically inside the human being and the community. This involves social grammar, role grammar, semantic and pragmatic.
•	Social grammar is the instrument to express something, all the elements to make a discourse.
•	Semantic is the words’ meaning and the relation among different words.
•	Pragmatic is the way in which we live concretely the rules. It is the practice.
It represents the life of law
Legal Data are composed by the outcome of legal processes (statutes, principles, papers of academics…)
They are produced by legal formant, starting from meta legal data through the work of legislators, judges…
It represents the creation of laws.
 


Key Map of Jurisdiction
    As Norbert Rolland says,in the same way in which we are all different and need to create a different identity, also legal systems are all different and needs to build their own essence.
Philip wood has classified the global law geography, drawing a map which explains his classification.
    In the world, there are 320 legal systems, of which 280 are influenced by the 3 main legal system.
•	Around 40% of global jurisdiction has been influenced by English Common Law.
•	30% by French legal system.
•	20% by the German legal system.

Uniform vs. Diversified Law (meta legal data)
There are three dimensions that are fundamental at influencing and so creating a legal system: history, culture, and mentality.
•	History includes social and economic developments (ex of social: same sex marriage; ex of economic: Antitrust). Legal systems that have the same level of social development, usually develop very similar rules, so it could be a factor of uniformity, as well as a factor of diversification.
•	Another feature is culture, composed by philosophy, religion, and ideology. The thinking of important people in a country has an important impact also on the society, the economics, politics and even law -making.
•	Diversification of law is also about mentality. Mentality is a concept already studied by Montesquieu in “l’espirit des nations” and Savigny in his “Volksgeist”. Mentality is the idea that there is something that we are sharing in our community. It comes from our history, our social, economic, political situation but even from our DNA.
Dealing with this many different cultures, makes the creation of uniform private law very challenging. 


Anthropology of law
Anthropology of law is specialized in the cross-cultural study of social ordering. It helps us understanding reasons, similarities, and differences between legal systems in the world, but it does not help us deal with such differences. A rule is effective if the legislator can express it in a way that results understandable to people.
What’s important for us from anthropology is the distinction between typical and atypical factors. The idea is that there were typical factors of the same communities and in religions such as Islam and Jewish:  they are legal system formed in different area of North Africa and South Asia and there the geographic situation is the same (same temperature, issues) and we can find in these religions same rules. 
Typical factors:
•	Geographic area
•	Social factors
•	Economic factors
Atypical factors:
•	Natural event
•	Disease
•	New intentions
•	Conqueror
•	Genius 
A typical factor as the geo localizations of the community acts on the rules. A typical factor could also have a social nature, like in the whole Europe nowadays recognize the same sex marriage (civil union). Why not in Arabia? The social factor is not the same. Another example is the economic factor: western legal systems are more developed. 
Then there are factors that creates differences also among legal systems that are similar in the typical factors: the atypical elements, something that happened just in these communities. 
For example, it could be a natural event, something that destroyed quickly the region. Atypical is something that a happens just one time, could not be reproduced.


Sociology of law
Sociology of law studies human behavior in society in so far as it is determined by commonly recognized ethical-legal norms and in so far as it influenced them. They study the human behavior in connection with the law production. Sociology helps to understand the reasons of different people behaviors despite same rules or same behaviors despite different rules (EX. Cameras in UK are allowed but not in Italy because of the privacy). We can’t transport a law in a different context without considering the sociology aspect (law in action). 
The Language
No matter if rules are expressed in a written or oral mode, the language always plays an important role. The language of law is expression of the identity of the community that have created the rules and it reflects history, mentality, culture of the community. 
Language of law is complicated. When written rules are written with simple word, they could be vague which is an issue for the interpreter. The French civil code for example was produced in part during the French Revolution and then during the napoleon time, it was the first experiment of codification inspired by the same ideal of the French Revolution, the idea of the possibility of writing rules for human being forever, without historical or a time context or a space context. The human being is the same through history, so it could be possible to write rules for every human being.
We have to give content, meaning to simple words. When there is a more detailed language as in the German civil code, even mother tongue can’t understand it if not educated. Because the German jurists considered the vagueness of the French civil code as something wrong. When we use a very technical legal language then you have to use each word with the same meaning, if not you will have ambiguity. This is what us can find in the Italian civil code, it’s a mix between French and German tradition. It’s not as vague as the French but is not as technically as the German. In the Italian civil code, we can find ambiguity. When we have this problem, we need interpretation.
Polysemy
It means that a word which has many meanings depending on the matter, on the area of law. From law in the books and law in action there is the intermediation between the interpreters of the law. There are many theories of interpretation, two mains:
TEXTUALISM: based on the text and try to purpose the attention in the words without going beyond the text. 
What happens when the text is wrong? In 1993 the directive in consumer contract law, there is a little requisite that make a connection between the good faith and…… this expression was translated in Italian in the wrong way. European directives have many languages as in the EU, all official. 
It could not be the right interpretation, the textual one which expressed the opposite of the original one, so in this case purposivism is fundamental.
PURPOSIVISM: the focus is on the text but also on the aim that had the legislator when the rules was created. Judges or scholar have to interpret the text to enforce the spirit of the rule and not just laying on the interpretation.
There are one side a semantic and on the other a pragmatic meaning of a rule .There is a distinction between what is said and what us implicated in a rule. We can make a distinction between concept and conception.
Legal concepts remain in the surface, to go deep inside we have to understand what happens on this concept once put in a dynamic world, our daily life. It happens that everyone intends and understand the concept differently. Beyond what is said there are a lot of implication. The concept is used referring to a general idea, in an objective way (contract, property.). 
Conception refers to the process of understanding mental concept. The meaning of conception refers to a way in which something is perceived.  Each legal system perceives a rule or a concept differently. 
Conception is subjective and concept is objective.

EXAMPLE
In the EU there are 24 different languages. There’s democracy, there’s not the linguistic culture of only one country that prevailed on the other. But on the other hand, the translation of everything is expensive. Nevertheless, multilinguist means also multi culture and it has an important role. What happens during a European debate in parliament? There will be the translation just in the three vehicular languages English, French and German and from this translation it’s translated in all the other languages. 
If there are mistakes in the translation that’s an issue during a discussion. 
When you explain rules in English is easier the reason is not just related to the easy grammar or the gender all neutral attitude of the English language, it depends of the fact that the English legal language comes from French and Latin. 
Common law was born after William the I; he came from Normandy, and he instituted the royal court in England and with that began the history of the English common law. From 1066 until the 1362 the language in the court was French, we have some judicial cases of that time in French from the 1362 until 1730 the language was Latin. Starting from the 18 th century the course began in English. There is not technically legal English is a mix between French and Latin so is easier to use it in global law. It means that easier to interpret, to translate. 
It could be even more difficult to write down rules and proportionally more complex is the subject of the rule the more complicated is the language of the text. 
A rule has to be seen in the same way from everybody. The legal language is a relevant aspect of the legal process for the creation of uniform private law. Eu plays an important role in the creation of uniform private law. 
The effort to create common rules are achieving the goal to create a new language, a new English that is not related to a single country. 



Method vs methodology 
Comparativists aim at finding commons point between jurisdictions, through 
•	Comparative method, which is a very simple one, superficial and descriptive. It objectively describes both the legal systems and highlights the differences
•	Comparative methodology which is based on: neutral approach (the purpose is the sense of community), legal and meta legal data.
It’s focused on: legal issues, as for example could be terminology.
It’s aimed at: guiding a dialogue and achieving dialectic synthesis between legal systems.
It’s needed to have a scientific and further point of view, trying to understand needs and goals of your counterparts.
However, this method is not used by everybody. An example is a business report aimed at understanding which are the efficient and the non efficient legal systems to start a business. The result was that the high rankings weee the ones of common law countries. In fact, the result was attacked by scholars from civil law systems, because they didn’t agree with the criteria used.



Civil Law
Ancient Roman Law (753 BC (Foundation of Rome) – 565 AD (enactment of Corps Iuris Civilis)).
In the beginning, law was unwritten. It was guarded and interpreted by upper class priests. Then, a revolution from the plebeian who wanted law to be written happened and, in 450 BC, the twelve tables were released. After that, all the written rules were annotated and integrated with the formulary system by Gaius.
Another step was the compilation of the Corpus Iuris Civilis: a collection of fundamental works in jurisprudence, issued by order of Justinian. It was composed by three parts:
-	Code: the compilation of imperial enactments.
-	Digest/Pandect: extracts from Roman jurists’ writing.
-	Institutes: student textbook; an explanation of ancient Roman law.
In France, just before the Corps Iuris Civilis, the Visigoths in the south released the Lex Romana Visigothorum, made by iura and leges. It constitutes a sort of a traditional law.
In the north, barbarians released the lex Salica, imposing their own barbarian customs.
Ius Commune (XI - XV century). Between the V and the XI century, there was not any book enabling to save the previous sources of law. The Ius commune brought a change in this situation. It was composed by
Canon Law (Roman law), Church and Corpus Iuris Civilis, that was rediscovered after many centuries it was being forgotten. The Corpus Iuris Civilis was subject both to rejection in continental Europe, and also object of studies, starting from the University of Bologna, which recomposed it after centuries.
With the beginning of the Renaissance, Legal Humanism happened (XV-XVII). Jurists began to consider roman law as object of historical studies. On the other hand, they developed an interaction between the Ius commune and Iura propria to build a new revolutionary system.
During the Enlightenment (XVII - XIX), national laws were developed. They mixed the heritage of Roman law with national customs.
As already pointed out, the civil law family encompasses the jurisdictions of continental Europe. These jurisdictions are usually characterized by the prevalence of statutory law as a source of law, namely for the central role attributed to the civil code as the systematic foundation of private law.
The forerunner of all contemporary civil codes has been the French one, enacted in 1804 by Napoleon and renamed in 1806 as the “Code Napoléon”.
This enactment was a historical event of extraordinary importance, because it paved the way for the season of the major national codifications, which sentenced the “ius commune” to death, by definitively replacing it. Even outside Europe, civil codes soon became the identity charters of national states, generally accompanying their establishment.
Civil Law Countries
In civil law countries, the prevailing source of law is statutory legislation. The key feature of such jurisdictions is that they have fully implemented the doctrine of separation of powers, the origins and genesis are generally traced to the French Enlightenment. Montesquieu clearly advocated for the separation of three lines of political power. This is also known as the Trias Politica principle.
In civil law jurisdictions courts are supposed to be the only “mouth that pronounces the words of the law”. Legislative power is in the hands of Parliament, which is the only state’s organ holding the power to adopt new legal rules.
The fact that a legal rule is valid, does not necessarily mean that it is effective. The former is known as validity, while the latter as effectiveness.
The Constitution is at the top of the hierarchy of the sources of law. In most jurisdictions of civil law, the Constitution is rigid, which means it cannot be amended through ordinary legislative acts; it can only be modified by a specific procedure of constitutional review.
Statutory laws are subject to the constitutional test. If an act of legislation has no meaning that is consistent with the constitution, it may be struck down (judicial review) by a specialized court. 





Origin and elements of a modern code
Until the 15th century we may not find a big distinction between civil law tradition and common law tradition. Something happened in Europe in the 15th century: the most important monarchies of continental Europe decided to impose their control over the communities to regain power against the lords that during the middle age on their lands decided what was legal and what was not with a complete discretion. 
The different monarchies decided to give the country an identity that had to be the identity of their king. 
Today is easy to understand which the rule is to be applied in a case, at the time it wasn’t possible, the judge just explained the final decision without motivation.
Then the French Revolution eliminated the social distinction between classes and it was based on the principle of equity, the legal subject (politician, judge, person, company) are all equal in front of the law. This is the characteristic of a modern codification. 
During French Revolution women and man were equal, every child had to have access to the assets of the father/mother in case of death. No matter if first born or second born, no matter their sex. 
Napoleon was the man who took all the principles, the ideology of French Revolution and composed it in the civil code. The French civil code was promulgated and entered into force in 1804, is the most modern code because the first characteristic is that is complete, exhaustive and it regulates the whole matter on private law. The second characteristic is that is exclusive. 
The third characteristic is that civil code has to be general (structured to disciple every situation for every private subject) and abstract (not detailed). 
Between the French civil code and the German civil code what happened was that the pandectists, German scholars, decided to create their own civil code using the German sources of law: ancient Roman law (corpus iuris civilis trough studied of bookings school), Canon law and barbarian.
The difference between the two is huge. French civil code was divided into 3 books. 
In the civil code we can find example of rules that he absolutely wanted in his code (inside the civil code there had to be adoption and divorce to be sure to be free to marry another woman and recognise the child, he was married without child). 
In the Mattei’s theory when the politician imposes rules in his own favour what they express is the hegemony of politics over the professionality of law. 
A second important influence that napoleon got on the civil code was about the language used: the language of the civil code is historically very vague and simple, so simple that is difficult to understand you don’t know what is referred to when the concept is so general and abstract, is very evocative. (In book 2 and 3 the French legislator use the world propriete to express two concepts: ownership and weld).
On the other hand BGB is divided into 5 books. We have a different approach: it’s easy to find the area of the issue you have. Also the distribution of the articles in the different books it’s not so unbalanced as in the French civil code. It’s characterised by an high level of dogmatism and conceptualism.

Common Law
William I, or the Conqueror, conquered England in 1066 and imposed (transplanted) a new kind of feudalism, which sets the basis for the distinction of common law. He stated that:
•	All land belongs to the king, but he distributed all these lands to his lords: military that helped him to conquer England. On their land the lords had the power to regulate the life of the people living in that area. William did not give lords a big piece of land to each lord to control them better.
•	To impose a tax system and to assure its functioning, he released the Domesday book, a record of all the lands.
•	A tax system without court (judges that sanction in case of no payment) is an inefficient instrument. A jurisdiction on tax law was needed, so he appointed the Curia Regis (royal court). The royal court worked on forms of actions: setting how to behave in case law was not respected. 
During a conflict there’s no tax system anymore, every threat to peace was a problem for the tax system so the royal court had to decide. 
                
           
At that time the power of the king was based on the Pope’s will, so the relationship between king and Pope was very relevant.
Henry II wanted to change this situation and made a new royal court, the Inns of Court, since the previous one was composed by priests only and he did not want such influence on his decisions. Inns of court are not real courts, they are colleges. The “pupils” were the young students lay man.
The inns of court are there to prepare barristers: lawyers that are legitimated to present and to discuss in trial in court. There's a difference between barristers and solicitors. Solicitors in England are also lawyers, but they may not discuss a case before a court. Usually, parties don’t have a direct connection with the barrister, the relation should pass through a solicitor.
 




It is from now that the principle of the stare decisis: binding precedent was subconsciously conceived. Once a case is discussed before a court and it decides the rule that is the motivation for the decision, this rule becomes binding. The writ used was always the same, but the decision made by the judges could be different depending on the facts. 
The rule of the precedent was not binding from the beginning: pupils to become barristers took notes and they gave these notes to the new pupils. Generation after generation pupils didn’t want to go against the traditions, so they considered ethically binding the precedents and then it became a legal principle.
Common law is based on case law (law are created on real cases and the principle of the binding precedent (hard law). This principle has an effect and works in two directions:
-horizontal: the judge must follow the previous decision of another country court
-vertical: if the house of lord\court of appeal decide a case, the rule on which this case is decided becomes binding for all the other judges and court on the law level.

A system developed on this principle: Common law jurisdiction
There are two tools, and both are at the disposal of the judges either in England as in the US, but in England the tradition considers only the distinguishing, the overruling was introduced in the English legal system in 1960 and only the court of appeal may use it. 
-DISTINGUISHING: judges apply the comparative method in the legal facts of a case. They have to search all the precedents that are consistent with the real case and then they have to compare the real fact that they had to decide with the real facts that were on the gourd of the judicial decision. They find what are the similarities and differences. If they find that there are significant differences, they are not allowed to apply the previous decision then they may create a new rule. Adapt the precedent to the new situation creating new rule.
-OVERRULING: it means “go over the rule”. Eliminate the precedent and substitute it with a new rule. In English law wasn’t considered a possibility because of the inns of court. The authority of the precedent was connected with the authority of the single judges.
In common law tradition countries, every single judge has to explain and expose his/her own opinion: there are two kinds of opinion in common law:
-CONCURRING: a judge that have to explain his/her own opinions agree with the rule applied by his/her college but basing this decision on different motivations. The same rule is applied but the application of this rule is based on different motivation respect to the previous judge.
-DISSENTING: “I don’t agree I have another opinion, I apply on the case a different rule”. 

A characteristic of the common law is that judges don’t speak for the public’s authority, they perceive themselves as an authority. If they do not perceive themselves as an authority, they won’t be elected in us, a not authoritative judge in England cannot be applied as judge.
In England during the trial (discussion between gentleman), you don’t overrule the rule that another judge with more experience than you, you have a sort of respect. 
Why overruling was created in us?
Judges are in competition is us they are elected with a campaign. Every judge has his\her idea of justice. In us having dissenting opinions was the tool that a judge used to show everybody his\her own personality and opinion.






During the reign of Henry, the II people preferred the inns of court to decide their cases because they were lay, independent from the king and from the lords. 
Henry II decided to crystallize the writs, it means that the chancellery is not allowed to create new writs, so the royal court hadn’t the chance to enlarge its power and to create new rules. The consequence was that after some years Henry II promulgated the second statute of Westminster: the king gave to the common lawyer, the royal court and the chancellery the possibility to create writs is consimili casu (actions in the case), applying the analogy because the cases were similar. 
The writs were not enough to develop the evolution of the royal court and the common law and to guarantee the peace, so that people began to ask for justice to the king saying “I don’t have a writ for my case”. Kings began to take decision on cases. 

 
Common Law vs. Equity; Judicature Acts
While common law was made by independent judges appointed by the king, the jurisdiction in equity was developed by priests. The jurisdiction in equity intervened in case where there were not any previous writs and suggested the king to reach a decision under their advice, according to the God’s justice.
•	The common law assumed an adversary approach: cases were discussed in the presence of witnesses and a jury of free men.
•	Jurisdiction in equity had an inquisitive approach, since that oaths and confessions under torture were common methods to reach an understanding. This reflects the behavior of the church at that time. In equity there’s just one writ: the writ of subpoena.
Finally, the Judicature Acts of 1873-1875 ended the dualism between the two jurisdictions, since all the binding courts were consolidated into the only Supreme Court of Judicature, which was directed to administer both law and equity. Judicature Acts signed the beginning of a completely free justice from religious elemets.
Ius & Lex
Law is composed by the principles of Ius and Lex.
•	 Ius is the immortal unrecorded law of God, of our ancestors. It is contained by the legal culture of a country. It is used in the interpretation of laws by judges.
•	Lex represents the actual binding rules.
We have a translation of Ius and Rex for every language but English, which links them into the word “law”.




Mixed Jurisdictions
They are first round in those local contexts where a piece of civil law coexists within a wider state context which is denoted by the common law instead. This is the case of Scotland, Louisiana, and Québec.
Moreover, a similar case can be found in Malta; but also, partially in Israel, which has built a legal system of its own starting from 1948. A particular case is South Africa, where the Dutch-Roman law is applied.

Comparative legal system
The origin of law
If the law is surely the product of history, social developments and language, it is also an intellectual product. Legislators, scholars, judges, practitioners make up a small social élite which is influenced by the dominant philosophical trends and ideologies. One has seen how much natural law theories and political thought have contributed to shape legal systems.
One can also classify systems by tracing their philosophical ancestry: idealism and positivism in continental Europe, realism across the Atlantic. There are no clear-cut distinctions between philosophical theories, and the law is influenced by a great number of other factors. What deserves to be pointed put is that many of the differences between legal systems are related to general epistemological approaches which not only determinate how norms are set, but especially directs the minds of those who are in charge of drafting, interpreting and implementing them. Law is part of a complex mental construction in which knowledge, scientific theory, economic models and ideology contribute to what German philosophers called a Welt Anschauung, a vision of the world.
Social norms vs. established laws
One of the most practical and relevant of these visions is social compliance with legal forms, i.e., norms set by public authority. One is talking not only of compliance with typical criminal law rules which criminologists carefully measure. What appears to be more important is compliance (conformazione) with:
•	private law, as payments od debts, relationships between neighbours, professional negligence…
•	administrative law as traffic rules, construction permits, waste disposal…
at the end of the day what one might be more interested in is not differences in structure and content of the systems and of their rules, but to what extent a legal system is effective.
One might even discover that different rules in the same fields are complied with equally in most countries.
Or that the same rules bear a very different rate of compliance. This research is more of a sociological nature.
From this perspective, one should consider the so-called “legal mentality”, which is not only how judges and scholars perceive the law, but also how a community interprets it, meant as an order or an obligation of a set of rules of conduct laid out by public authority. One could group systems in which norms are seen as an essential element of the good functioning of society. Without norms, there is social disorder which brings anarchy; and on the opposite side we find communities in which there is a deep scepticism in the usefulness of such norms which are seen as an obstacle to individual freedom. 
Comparative lawyers have always attempted to point out that formalized norms were and are only a small part of a much broader picture. Societies are governed not only through commands that come from established authorities, but -especially in daily lives- through what are called ‘social norms’ which keep a community together, set in the black-letters of law. Often social norms ignore State boundaries and a continuous interplay between the two forms of law which try to prevail.
Law can in fact be expressed as a concept and a conception:
•	Concept is the general and objective idea.
•	Conception is the subjective idea, the legal system of idea of contract. It depends on perception, and how the concept is understood.
This distinction helps setting the boundaries of normative and linguistic determinants of legal content. Jurists as lawyer, scholars and judges have an interest in maintaining a strategic form of communication between them. Zencovich spoke about an élite language that they keep in order to maintain a certain power over it.
Global Rules & Private Actors
Economic activities require the existence of rules and their enforcement as preconditions that the market cannot generate itself. Property rights, contractual rights and obligations, are minimal prerequisites for modern societies that are provided and enforced by the state. Without such prerequisites, the market cannot flourish. The state thus determines regulations and delineates the sphere of private freedom, within which individual citizens and private institutions are entitled to conclude contracts with one another, to which the system of property and contractual rights compels obedience.
•	In the development of modern nation states, the state has been the guarantor of civil rights.
•	In its role as a democratic constitutional state, it has also been the guarantor of political participation rights, the right of the citizen to take part in the processes that determine public rules and issues of public concern. 
•	Finally, in its role as a welfare state, it has provided social rights for citizens, such as the right to education, to health care, and to other forms of welfare.
The combination of state-guaranteed civil, political, and social rights has provided legitimacy, solidarity, and welfare to modem society, thereby contributing to peaceful, stable communities of anonymous individuals. Following Matten and Crane we refer to this triad of rights as citizenship rights. 
Today, the dimensions and the limits of state intervention, particularly the relationship between public care and private responsibility, are widely discussed. Nevertheless, even classically liberal and libertarian authors from economics such as Hayek, Nozick, and Friedman, agree that certain rules need to be implemented for an economy to function properly. They suggest that these rules can only be created and enforced by the state.
The implementation of transnational corporations
In a globalized world, however, global governance is no longer a task managed by the state alone. Today, transnational corporations (TNCs), as well as civil society groups, increasingly participate in the formulation and implementation of rules in policy areas that were once the sole responsibility of the state or international governmental organizations. The activities of TNCs and civil society groups include involvement in peacekeeping, protecting human rights, or implementing social and environmental standards. This development indicates a shift in global business regulations from state-centric forms toward new
multilateral, non-territorial modes of regulation, with the participation of private and non-governmental actors. 
Mathews has argued that international standards, as defined by corporations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), or international organizations, create worldwide standards of conduct that are "gradually beginning to override claims of national or regional singularity".
Zencovich: Models for a Globalized World
Legal systems are the result of the evolution of society, which are not confined within the boundaries of national States. The two historical events that have produced the phenomenon of “globalization” are the fall of communism regimes and the gradual opening to foreign trade for the Republic of China. 
The systematic impact of globalization cannot be seen exclusively from a normative perspective. Uniform laws can be seen as technical-legal standards which satisfy internal stakeholders. When a system encompasses these laws, it creates a level playing field which reduces the differences from other systems. Since the Middle Ages merchants had created many autonomous procedural rules, which received approval from the established authorities. 
In systems without a code the parties had to engage in extremely complex drafting, establishing each time terms and conditions. With globalization, the parties must agree on extremely complex and complete texts which should be able to govern the whole transaction without having to use others’ legal norms. The result is a very sophisticated legal system whose actors are most exclusively private parties of very large dimensions. From a comparative legal systems approach, it would appear that global “Lex Mercatoria” is an attempt to escape from the complexity of contemporary legal systems , which are subject to countless variables. If this “Lex” is an attempt to create a self-sufficient legal system, international political and economic relations have given birth to a host of institutions which are part of a broader system that imposes itself over national systems.
During the last century, several examples of institutions were created:
-	The main global organization is the United Nations (1945). It forms part of a wider system which includes numerous other specific organizations (FAO, WHO, UNESCO).
The UN system clearly represents the limits of the universal legal principles. Its most founding text, the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights” (1948), is substantially ignored by most of half of its members.
-	Two important institutions have a fundamental role: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank (WB).
-	The World Trade Organization (WTO) has the specific aim of favoring international trade through the elimination or reduction of barriers.
We should take into account that international law, as we know it for the last centuries, is a typical product of Western legal culture. Traditionally, international law is structured according to typical continental European model. 
Zencovich: Judges
The role of judges in a legal system has always been considered fundamental. The traditional common law/civil law distinction is based on the historical fact that the former is a judge-made system, very different from that of civil law, not only because judges have gradually built the systems through their decisions, but also because of the procedures through which judges are appointed.
The first element that must be considered is the very long-standing difference in the selection and appointment of judges. A further element that must be considered is judicial organization. In the continental European model, the judiciary, historically, is part of public administration and only rather recently it received specific and constitutional guarantees of independence. Any judicial system stands on procedural rules, and without procedural rules it cannot exist.
Taxonomy (or systemology or macro comparison)
Taxonomy provides the intellectual framework of the law and it makes its complexity more manageable. It can be defined as the grammar of the legal discourse. Taxonomy reflects the legal culture of a given legal system; it is the product of the interaction of the legal tradition and of the new sensibilities. Systemology of the legal system also said as macro comparison because we have to look at all the legal system if the world in order to create a map of the legal systems.
Taxonomy is not an end in itself; instead, it is a mean to enrich our comparative understanding of legal systems. Consequently, no taxonomy can claim universality; it is important to state at the beginning what is the purpose of the taxonomy that one proposes.
Taxonomy, when aging, needs upgrading.
The geo-legal world map needs to be revised: it cannot be Euro-American centred anymore because new legal systems are gaining importance and making progresses at a faster rate.
Comparative law, for example, needs a simpler classification. It starts from the supposition that in all societies there are three main sources of social norms which affect individual’s behaviour: politics, laws and religion. Any pattern of social control is law.
These three patterns generate legal systems. Taxonomy plays an important role:
In transferring knowledge from one area of the law, the country or the world to another. When there are similarities between legal systems there’s the opportunity to create similar rules.
 In the world of legal globalization, transfers of knowledge are needed not only within different areas of a given legal system but also between different legal systems. In the last centuries there was the idea that comparison was possible only between countries belonging  to the same legal tradition. After the WWII it was important to find a common point of view, for example liabilities were intended in a different way. Anyway we can distinguish the Roman-Germanic family, made by all the legal systems inspired by the German legal systems and the French family, composed by all the legal systems which has the French civil code as model.
 -taxonomy pays an important role to identify the differences or similarities in the path of legal system. The legal culture is something that differentiate one legal system to another. Every legal system forms with different formants its own rule, based on its philosophy, mentality, history…
Ugo Mattei
Before Mattei’s theory the problem was that all the taxonomies were based on Euro-American centric approach, with the principle of legal imperialism: western legal systems are the best (nothing to learn from the other legal systems attitude). Another factor that influenced the taxonomies was the marginalisation of radically different cultures such as Japanese and Chinese. The Second World War made possible to go forward and to reject marginalisation and legal imperialism. 
Mattei’s theory is based on the fact that avery legal system has a dignity that has to be respected. There is the need to find a global taxonomy where every legal system finds its own place. 
Mattei thinks that legal systems are dynamic (“Legal systems never are, they always become”) and can change their position over the triangle scheme over time. 
Ugo Mattei developed the theory of the three patterns of law. In every society, there are three main sources of social norms:
•	Politics (P) (legal process is often determined by political relationships)
•	Professional law (L) (Wester tradition, includes civil and common law distinction)
•	Tradition (T) (religious and philosophical)
All three patterns are seen at play at the same time but the outcome of the competition among them is different.
Consequently, legal systems can be grouped in families according to the hegemony of one certain pattern.
Let us make an example of an outcome that shows a case in which the political pattern prevailed over the legislative one. In Italy, 1996, the public opinion was shaken by the acquittal of the Nazi criminal Eric Priebke by a Court in Rome. After the innocent verdict was given, the then Minister of Justice, Professor Flick, ordered the police to re-arrest Priebke, legally a free man, to stop the riots that ensued.
This decision was clearly against the notion of “rule of law”; nevertheless, it was justified the following day on legal grounds -i.e., Art. 716 of the Code of Criminal Procedure granted him the power to re-arrest him because a German request for extradition was pending-
The three patterns correspond to the leading systems of social organization; this latter term is used in its broader meaning of the administration of all social interactions taking place in everyday life of a community. The popular assumption that western centrism is the foundation of a classification of LS that aims to cover the whole world must be rejected; indeed, any classification must take into account the deep-rooted differences between all models of social organizations.
Because of this plurality it is impossible to achieve a final rigid classification; as a matter of fact, it is based on an “impression” of hegemony, acknowledging that LS are mixed.
The Western Legal Tradition can be considered a highly homogenous family corresponding to the rule of professional law. This homogeneity is due to two factors: the legal arena is clearly distinguishable from the political arena, and the legal process is largely secularized. In other words, the legitimacy of the law is neither of political nor of religious origin, but rather of technical nature.
One of the first example regarding the clear distinction between the legal and political landscape happened in England, at the time of Sir. Edward Coke, when the king was denied participation in the adjudication process in his court because he lacked professional training.
The rule of Politics comprehends the systems in which the political and legal processes cannot be separated. It does not mean that the law is absent but that it is extremely marginalized and weak in respect of other sources of social rulemaking -e.g., political power-
In countries such as Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe the legal process is often determined by political relationships. In those social contexts there is no such notion as a formal law binding on government. In those systems both high-level and low-level decisions are made by the political power to “secure” the social stability.
Many aspects of the rule of political power can be found in the systems of rule of Professional law -e.g., Italy labeled as “corruption”.
The countries within the rule of Politics -e.g., Russia, African Countries - can be compared because they have common problems such as weak courts, low-level of democratic structures, etc. This model could also be referred to as the “law of development and transition: decisions are usually centralized, and the goal is often the one of self-sufficiency.
The rule of Tradition systems consists in those where the separation between law and religious tradition has not taken place. The need for separation between law and religion is of ancient origin: it harks back to the Institution of Universities in the Eleventh Century, when theology, philosophy and law became autonomous disciplines. Medieval academic learning was highly textual, and the texts on which lawyers (corpus Iuris Civilis) and theologists (the Bible) based their studies were different.
Doubts may also further arise with respect to Indian Law: it has a heavily westernized constitutional structure but a deeply rooted tradition of Hindu Law. As a matter of fact, India could be placed within the rules of Tradition. In Western Legal Tradition religion may govern the inner conscience of individuals and consequently it could be considered as the province of the priests; on the other hand, the relationships between individuals, organizations, and institutions in society are province of lawyers. 
In the rule of traditional law family, the individual’s internal dimension and the societal dimension are not separated: they are both under the radar of religion or transcendental philosophy. The family of the rule of traditional law is composed by Islamic law, Indian Law and other Hindu Law countries, and Asian countries.
In Mattei’s taxonomy, the traditional distinction between common law and civil law is considered a subdivision within a highly homogeneous family of legal systems: the western legal tradition or, more appropriately, the rule of professional law.
LEGAL TRANSPLANTS
Comparative Legal System
The Origin of Law
If the law is surely the product of history, social developments and language, then it is also an intellectual product. Legislators, scholars, judges, practitioners make up a small social élite which is influenced by the dominant philosophical trends and ideologies. One has seen how much natural law theories and political thought have contributed to shape legal systems.
One can also classify systems by tracing their philosophical ancestry: idealism and positivism in continental Europe, realism across the Atlantic. Clearly there are no clear-cut distinctions between philosophical theories, and the law is influenced by a great number of other factors. What deserves to be pointed out is that many of the differences between legal systems are related to general epistemological approaches which not only determinate how norms are set, but especially directs the minds of those who are in charge of drafting, interpreting and implementing them. The law is part of a complex mental construction in which knowledge, scientific theory, economic models and ideology contribute to what German philosophers called a Welt Anschauung, a vision of the world.
Legal Transfer and legal Transplants 
Laws can sometimes travel from one community to another one, through
•	Transplant, when laws which come from a legal system are put inside another one without being varied. For this reason it is very likely to fail.
•	Transfer, which could also happen without implying transplant (when laws are inspiration and subjects for reasonings in another legal system).
Legal concepts, rules and procedures can “fly” between legal system: when it happens they are called model . Here there are some examples:
•	Legal concepts = the Anglo American trust. It’s a three part fiduciary relationship in which the first party, the settlor (original owner) , transfer a property upon the second party, the trustee (legal owner of the property in trust),  for the benefit  of a third party, the beneficiary (owner in equity).
They all have a power on the Trust Fund, however it exists segregated from them thanks to the legal concept of segregation, which means that every party is somehow owner of the trust fund but none of them can attack the trust fund. Indeed in this legal system the property is not considered as an absolute and unique right. The concept behind this is that there are many estates and many different kinds of ownership, not just property. 
Settlor is the original owner of the trust fund. Trustee is the owner in trust and the only one who can manage the trust fund, but not for his benefit; they’re the only one who could have some creditors due to the expenses needed to manage it. The Beneficiary are owner in equity, they control the trustee and present law suit against him when he manage the trust fund in a wrong way. So all these subject have a power on the trust fund but it exists segregated.  Only the creditors may attack the trust fund.
This legal concept can’t be transplanted in Europe because you can’t segregate assets. Property is considered as an absolute right that can’t be segregated. Every assets have a subject and can’t exist just for itself.
It’s very useful for international transaction, and there’s been a international convention for making this concept valid in other legal systems.
France wanted to be attractive as Uk or USA so they introduced the trust, which is named FIDUCIE and was introduced at the beginning of this century, but it’s different. It has a lot of limits because only companies in the financial sector can create it, it has a time limit of validity and it’s supposed to be for very specific purposes. 
In common law tradition the translation of proprietà is properties, plural, because it corresponds to many different legal estates.
•	Rules: seat belt rule 
•	Legal procedures: Mexican amparo. Amparo 1857 became part of the Mexican constitution. We didn’t have another legal figure as it before it was introduced in Mexico. It’s the right of everyone to recourse to a competent court for protection against acts that violate fundamental rights, recognised by constitution or laws of the state concerned. 
In italy, for example, it’s different: you can’t present a law suit and go against a rule that violates human rights, asking to eliminate it. You can’t even ask to be restored for the damages to the constitutional court. You have to ask to a ordinary court which can decide to go to the constitutional one or not.
In Mexico they changed this situation with this judicial remedy that makes possible for every individual that consider violated his fundamental right to go against public rules, asking for the elimination or a restore. 


(Ha detto che non saranno parte dell’esame questi esempi, lo spero vivamente per lei.)


There are two ways in which we can make legal transplants.
•	Ratio auctoritate it’s made by force, an imposition. 
Ex. Colonisation of South Africa when common law tradition was imposed.
•	Auctoritas ratione due to the fact that the model is extremely practical, good, efficient, advantageous. By force of reason, the model itself has an authority and impose itself.
Ex. In Belgium it was introduced the French civil code and it’s been kept for more than 200years. It had identical rules but different interpretation.



 
 
Legal Transplants thinkers
Prehistory of Legal Transplants
Savigny (German) and Montesquieu (French) are the most important personalities in the evolution of their respective legal systems.
 Savigny was the promoter of the development of the German legal system during the 19 th century. His theory is based on countries’ custom and traditional values, leading to the transplantation of legal systems. He criticized that imported laws are not suited for a certain local context.
 Montesquieu published in 1749 “De l’esprit des lois” in which he describes how every institutional system is based on ethos, the customs of each country, composed of the climate, religion, laws, laws government maxims, examples of past things, customs and manners. 
Alan Watson (inventor, supporter)
The term legal transplant was coined in the 1970s by the Scottish-American legal scholar Alan Watson to indicate the moving of a rule or a system of law from one country to another.
Watson thought that the proper task of comparative law, as an academic discipline, was to explore the relationship between legal systems. He claimed that there was no necessary connection between laws and the society in which they operated. According to him, laws were usually borrowed from elsewhere , so that laws often operated in societies and in places very different from those in which they had initially developed: there is not any necessary connection between laws in the society in which they operate and the society itself. According to his thought, transplanting of laws was easy. The most criticized aspect of Watson’s publication was not about the existence of legal transplant but that any idea could be transformed into domestic law and no systematic knowledge of the law, neither political structure (Debate Watson/KahnFreund).
For Watson, the value of comparative law lies fundamentally in its capacity to explain legal developments, the relationship of law to society, and at this stage of its development the simplest way to exploit comparative law is by examining, and accounting for, similarities and differences in systems that have a historical relationship.
By the end of the first decade of the 21 st century, the concept of legal Transplant as developed by Alan Watson has become a standard way to approach Comparative law.
LEGAL TRANSPLANTS: AN APPROACH TO COMPARATIVE LAW(1974)

Rodolfo Sacco (supporter)
Rodolfo Sacco (1974) linked the phenomena described by Watson with methodological issues of comparative law. In 1977 he presented the theory of legal formants: the legal landscape consists of components not necessarily coherent with each other rather than of a hierarchical set of norms (law making is a confused process that can also be in conflict with itself). The influence of Sacco in Italy and France further publicized Watson’s work and made it familiar for Europeans. By 1985 there was no longer a blunt rejection of Watson’s views (but rather a claim about the forces behind legal change): the basic thesis of legal transplant was now claimed as accepted by all comparative lawyers .
To help this process, responsiveness, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility are necessary elements:
 Responsiveness: the more it adapts to the change in need of society, the better it is.
 Comprehensiveness: more answers it gives to law, the more comprehensive it is.
 Comprehensibility: the law must be understandable by who is affected.
Galindo (supporter)
Galindo was a law student in the universe of Edinburgh; he attended Watson’s classes and got a PhD with him as tutor. Movement is, to him, what characterizes the idea of a legal transplant, a rule, institution or knowledge identified in a social group is transported to another.
Watson’s version of legal transplants is characterized by a spatial dimension. Legal movement from one localized place to another, such as a state or community, occurs frequently and, in turn, propels another movement: the development or evolution of specific legal rules or a legal system. 
For Galindo, there is another dimension, apparently neglected by most comparatists, that strongly affects the way legal transplants operate: time. The attempt to transplant a rule or argument from one legal system to another involves an expectation that someone wants to be fulfilled in the future . A legal transplant can be viewed as a collection of experiences that happened in one legal system and are expected to be realized in the future in a different legal system . Therefore, legal transplants are not devoid of a sense of the future; as expectations, they try to anticipate the future and, consequently, change it. 
In a broader perspective, this article aims to bring comparatists and legal historians closer together. 
Milton Friedman (critic)
Milton Friedman considered Watson’s theory unconvincing because law is “confused” due to economic and social pressures. About the borrowing factor, Milton states that law is always borrowed with the use of decision-making.
Rodolfo Sacco supports Watson’s theory: he believes that it helps the sharing of the jurisdiction among the world. 
Pierre Legrand (critic)
Pierre Legrand is one of the old-fashioned comparatists, one of the main critics of legal transplants: he thinks that they are impossible. According to Legrand, after transplantation, laws might look the same, but must be implemented by official with radically different legal mentalities. Legal roots may be transferred, but the ethos does not travel. Law simply could not be separated from its context. Law only has a meaning in context; change the context and the law changes.
Bernhard Grossfeld (critic)
Bernhard Grossfeld argued that legal systems were very closely linked to culture generally, including religion, language, and geography. So, he accepted some of what Watson reasoned; but disagreed with what
he considered as Watson’s optimism “about the possibility of transplanting legal institutions.”
He argued that law simply could not be separated from its context. In other words, law only has a meaning in context; change the context and the law changes . Much of Legrand’s argument against transplants arises from his opposition to the calls for a European Civil Code, in his opinion too difficult to create and enforce.
Otto Khan-Freund (critic)
Otto Khan-Freund believed that transplanting law is “un grand hazard”, as Montesquieu said, since any attempt to use a pattern of law outside the environment entails the risk of rejection since all the factors (mainly the socio-political context), and not only the legal one, must be taken into account.
•	 In 1977, professor Merryman pronounced an important unanswered question:” are legal transplant successful?”
•	In 1981, Pnina Lahav tries to answer that question, claiming that the American law in Israel would be rejected.
•	Alan Stain distinguished Watson and Khan-Freund’s works.
•	Watson tended to take a macro legal view, contemplating the huge transplants, that appear as milestones on the large scale of world history.
•	Khan-Freund adopted instead a micro legal view, concentrating on modern law reform.
M. Graziadei – the micro perspective
Legal transplants are not exceptional or isolated occurrences, despite the economic, social, political and cultural barriers that separate the world’s legal systems. The key notion advanced is the notion of mediated action, which denotes actions performed by individuals making use of features of the environment as tools to interact in a specific setting.
What he proposes is to add to an analysis of the "micro" level of individual action which is implicated in the transplant. The analysis of the contexts in which discourse turns into action also shows the importance of ideologies as a mean toward the legitimization of norms, including transplanted norms . Ideologies as forms of action-oriented beliefs respond to the need to build consensus or resistance to the transplanted law. They transform power into influence. The micro perspective on legal transplants advanced here conceives of ideology in functional terms, as a means of coordinating the actions of the members of a group, whether dominant or not. It is in the nature of ideology that its adherents will mostly act in the same way in a similar situation, show willingness to carry out joint tasks, and contribute to group cohesion.
Grozev: Auto acculturation = norms replacing culture 
Grozev formulates two plausible hypotheses.
1.	First, that when a transplanted legal norm does not contradict an entrenched, strong local norms become a default cultural preference via its prototypicality status.
2.	Second, that when such transplanted legal norm does run contrary to a strong, incompatible cultural preference, the norm achieves precedence over the cultural preference over a single generational change. 
To him, legal transplants are possible and sustainable, in part due to the fact that once transplanted, legal norms achieve prototypicality in their own category, and furthermore over time become part of the same local culture that initially may be largely incompatible with them; a phenomenon that may be termed auto acculturation.
The Triumph of Legal Transplants: 1986-2013
In the last quarter-century, the use of the term “legal transplants” became universal. Watson’s arguments have provided standard means of analysis in comparative law. What matters the most is the attitude of the lawyers and the lawmakers who may act as a filter of social demands.
Malicious Legal Transplants
If a country is facing certain problem, it can decide to adopt rules that have helped another country to solve the same problem before. It is important thought that lender and the borrower country have similar backgrounds, so to avoid malicious legal transplants. There is diversity as regards the circumstances that can lead to a transplant. In the normative research about legal transplants, a helpful division is between optimists and pessimists. The pessimists object that, in practice, legal transplants are often unfavourable to the incoming legal system.
For ‘malicious legal transplants’ it follows that they can also concern any legal object and be either of an involuntary or a voluntary nature. In addition, in order to be ‘malicious’ there needs to be intention to do harm. Thus, ‘malicious legal transplants’ have an objective element (‘ harm’), for example, where one group in society imposes its social norms on another one without need. In addition, the subjective element means that at least one actor of the transplant process recognises the use of the transplant in such a manner. Thus, this is different from a situation where a legal transplant merely does not work well due to some kind of unintended consequence.
Legal 	transplants
Pros	Cons
Even if a legal transplant does not perfectly fit, it can stimulate changes in the society it is applied in.	Legal irritants: legal transplants can have polluting or disrupting effects on the domestic legal order.
Transplanting law prevents law makers from the costing of drafting a new law on their own.	Legal transplants often fail due to lack of enforcements or general unsuitability.
The lender country can benefit from the law transplant since it creates a familiar legal system that for example can make firms from the two countries collaborate better.	Where law and religion are not strictly separated, there is a strong risk of authoritarianism.
The lender country benefits of the prestige of having its law transplanted.	
For example, it has been suggested that the US racial segregation laws of the nineteenth century seemed to have influenced the laws of racial identification and purity in Nazi Germany. With more confidence it can be said that the Nazi laws influenced the laws of Mussolini’s Italy. E xamples have in common that the prior position of the transplant country was receptive towards differences in race, religion and sexual orientation. This situation is therefore different from the type of legal transplants, more frequently discussed in the literature, where the traditional culture of the transplant country had been prejudiced towards the behaviour that the transplant aimed to introduce; for example, transplants that aimed to liberalise family law in terms of allowing no fault divorce or introducing same-sex unions. 
The adoption of the foreign idea can have the aim of creating or fostering an international alliance with the origin country. There can also be financial incentives, for example where the transplant country agrees to follow certain rules of the origin country in exchange for foreign aid supporting its education, healthcare etc.
Westbrook - Diffusion of Law
Diffusion of law is a matter of comparative law. Professor Westbrook makes clear that globalization cannot be avoided, and that diffusion of law is deeply related to it. The term “diffusion” suggests that law may lose its identity in order to be spread all around the world. “Diffusion” is a term that defines a process, and that can be replaced by the term “Modernization”. Globalization and diffusion of law cannot be separated. The words “diffusion” and “globalization” share something important.
What he intends to sketch is what happens if we understand the “diffusion of law” as instances of the modernization of authority. According to Westbrook, there are four different ways to define authority.
A way to understand diffusion of law, in fact, is imperially. With imperialism  we mean when sovereign Imperium (with imperialism)
impress itself upon people outside its established borders, so expands commercially, military and culturally.
Thus, diffusion of law or modernization in that sense is accomplished by power.
However, imperial will is an insufficient way to understand the diffusion of law. First, imperialism simplifies the relations between the law and the will of the sovereign, thus the relationships between political intention and law must be even more complicated outside the jurisdiction of the sovereign we are considering.  Law simply is not some package of data that can be replicated everywhere. Indeed, the concept of law is also
systems. Rather than diffuse, we can say that modern laws are re-presented by other jurisdictions. So, law is linked to the recognition of the authority by the subjects of the laws. This means that power requires the participation of the subjects, who conform themselves to some established standards.    
Individuals and entire societies model themselves. Some contemporary scientists state that a tendency to  Fashion = people copy each other for fashion = modernization
Since diffusion of law is basically an adoption of law, then a legal system changes in accordance with what people believe to be modern, and this belief is formed in view of the examples provided by other legal
applied to a jurisdiction, in view of other legal systems’ examples.  (Understanding the modern in terms of fashion, is not restricted to law). 
copy our fellows is a characteristic of humans. So, it is not surprising that legal system may adopt laws first pronounced elsewhere. Cultural features, including law, are adopted because the people believe them to be better, that is, modernization that is the adoption of a new way of doing things may happen because people try to be modern.  
 System = recent forming of new legal structures and pillar
Modernization can be also seen as the formation of new structures so, when considering a system, we must take into account its different building pillars and its own distinct characteristics; and the new global scenario deeply it can be added that actually people gave the law to state, not the other way around.differentiation;  So, this  is setting new rules, deeply changing the shape of what we have experienced till now. Socially speaking, interactions have evolved and so the structures that regulate them, resulting in the aim to create a global law.
 Tribe
Law can be formed among person without considering the location, like law between religious people. When we say civil society, usually we mean legal relations that operate among people rather than state. To go perspective says: state is not source of authoring, state does not occupy the foundational position in to focus on   so, understanding modern authority through Tribal perspective give us an  
positive thought. Instead, people occupy this foundational position. People are source of authority view. In the nomadic state evoked by “tribal” we encounter the contemporary in its emphasis on people rather than territory, the tribal imagination may be seen as a product, rather than a rejection, of globalization. Tribal provides what culture once did, community solidarity.
The Tribal perspective, like the imperial one, focuses on the creation of social status, the classification of people as members or non-members of the tribe, as insider or outside the bounds of the empire, as Greek or barbarian. To counter the homogenizing connotations of the word globalization and diffusion of law we need intellectual advance.
	SACCO	 -	 LEGAL	 FORMANTS
 
Sacco: The Aims of Comparative Law
Comparative law is like other sciences in that its aim must be the acquisition of knowledge. In particular, it seeks knowledge of legal rules and institutions. It presupposes the existence of a plurality of legal systems and institutions; it studies them in order to establish to what extent they are identical or different. Comparative studies have also potential practical application: obtain uniformity among legal systems or transplanting foreign laws into the domestic system. Comparison measures the extent of differences be they small or large; it must not discuss only the common core of different legal systems or only their distinctive elements but must take into consideration the whole structure (both the surface layer and the infrastructure).
Collega cosa dei problemi di translation
According to Sacco, every legal system is created by just three legal formants through books or actions:
•	Judicial, typical of England and all common law countries, is based on case law and the principle of stare decisis.
•	Legislative, traditionally prevailing in civil law systems. it is historically linked to the French law (code Napoleon).
•	Doctrinal, which played the most important role in German codification and is still powerful in civil systems. Doctrinal formant differs from legislative one on the interpretation of law.
These three formants play together.
•	The fourth legal formant is practice, which is still into really recognized as such.
To speak of comparison, one must have something to compare. Students of comparative law compare the “rules of different legal systems”. It is misleading to speak of the legal rule in force in a given country as if there were only one such rule; as a matter of fact, the term legal rule should be substituted with the ones of rules of the constitution, legislation, courts etc.
Within a given legal system there is not such unity in “legal rules”; as a matter of fact, a legal system has a plurality of legal formants that do not guarantee harmony among them. Comparison recognizes that the legal formants within a system are not always uniform and therefore contradiction is possible. Since statutes are
not the entire law (Civil Law) and the decision of a court is not the entire law (Common Law), it is necessary to recognize all the legal formants and their scope. 
A legal system contains a wide range of legal formants which have different relevance among different legal systems: for example, in English law statutes could be wholly lacking.
The assumption that legal rules can only be created by organs of government charged with legislative power is wrong. Since we said that the legal formants within a legal system are not in harmony, we can also say that the sources of law could vary; as a matter of fact, many rules are created by judges, arbitrators, and administrative bodies. The positivist view that law is created and enforced only by the State creates a dangerous optical illusion. Law cannot be applied unless it is interpreted: there must be an interaction between a primary source, such as statute or precedent, and an interpretation. 
How can legislation be respected? It must be clear, precise and easy to understand by the judge who must enforce it; also, it must be felt by those who enforce it. An important form of sacralization takes place when a society elevates the authors of the law to a level higher than the rule itself. The idea that the Corpus Juris Civilis was compiled by a sort of divine mandate is expressed in Dante’s masterpiece “The Divine Comedy”, in which Justinian is put in heaven. Also, a doctrinal proposition can be considered a source of law: it may describe the content of a rule or a method to be followed in reaching legal conclusions. 
Tort/liability
Normally, to recover, plaintiff must show the defendant was at fault and his fault caused the damage that the plaintiff has suffered. Whether there is another element necessary for the plaintiff to recover -i.e. “The objective element”- which is required, then any damage caused by fault will not give rise to liability. The latter, known as principle of the neminem laedere -i.e., “Injure no one”- is the basis of Code Napoleon, Art. 1382: “Liability is imposed for any action of a man which causes damage to another”.
The other view, which is influenced by German thought, says something different: liability should be imposed only in exceptional cases. According to the German Civil Code, individuals are not liable unless they intentionally or negligently injure “the life, body, health, freedom, property, or similar rights of the victim”. Thus, liability requires something more than fault. In Italy, the situation seems hybrid: the judge applies the narrower rule when he does not impose liability and the broader when he does. 
In England and the US, until recently, liability was imposed only on some specific torts: trespass (one interferes with the property of the victim), conversion (one behaves as the owner of a property), and nuisance (one interferes with the use of property).
Towards the end of the last century, also negligence became a tort. The elements of an action of negligence are four: a duty of care, a violation of this duty, a harm, a harm caused proximately by the violation. If these elements are established and the defendant was under a duty to act with care, liability is imposed in English and American law. 
The final problem is the one of transfer of movable property. With the word “property”, we mean the object owned by a person. Property can assume different location, for this reason we give it the adjective “movable”. The elements required by various legal systems or three: consent, cause, and delivery. 
Consent and cause are part of what we call Titulus, while delivery is the Modus. There is a great gap between the Roman Law and the Italian Rule, consisting in the fact that in the former the property is transferred by delivery, while in the latter the consent and the cause are linked. 
There exist some cases in which the titulus prevails over the modus, or vice-versa. For example, in France, delivery is not necessary: they use the method of titulus alone. In Germany, however, they use the modus alone, according to Savigny’s thought. An example of both the usage of titulus and modus is Austria.
The legal formants which are not born explicitly formulated can be called “crypto types”: they are legal formants diverging from the explicit formulations of a system.
We realized we are in the presence of a non-verbalized rule when a decision is made differently than the one, we would envision from the rule as formulated. Both legal formants, the obvious (synecdoche) and the hidden ones (crypto types) become evident when more than one system is examined through comparative studies.
Legal formants change (not always at the same pace) and that there are three important concepts in this process, that are: borrowing, imitation, and innovation. 
Borrowing and imitation are therefore of central importance to understanding the course of a legal change.
The notion of “negozio giuridico” is not mentioned in the Italian Civil Code; it was borrowed from the German Civil Code. The French Civil Code has had many imitators: the Codice Albertino, the Italian Civil Code, the Swiss Civil Code, the Codice Borbonico and many more.
As we can see, borrowing is very used by legislators and scholars, less by judges. Nevertheless, there are some cases of judicial borrowing -e.g., direct imitation of judges by judges.
But what causes imitation? Similarities in cultural, environmental, economic, and social conditions can be crucial; nevertheless, there are two fundamental causes -i.e., imposition and prestige-
 Imposition, more intense and unilateral, happens when someone with the power tends to impose his will. Reception due to pure force, however, are reversible and end when the force is removed.
 The most effective method is caused by prestige, which corresponds to the desire to appropriate the work of others. Prestige is overall the most effective cause of diffusion -e.g., from legal systems to clothes and fashion, and to music-
Finally, we can state that a legal system tends to borrow when it is incomplete. An incomplete system will tend to imitate just to fill the gaps.
The last concept which is central in the dynamic process of changes is innovation. Innovations are made continually; However, the only innovations that matter are those that originate from an authority or that are adopted by an authority. Innovation may depend upon social facts that go beyond the legal system itself; it may depend upon evolution or revolution. Innovation can be produced by a desire to seek harmony, analogy, or a simulation. Despite the concept of authority, an important type of innovation is the one that spreads from “normal power”, and that is strong enough to diffuse itself among a plurality of people.
A systematic collection and the errors made by first-year university students in their exams would be of the greatest interest.
SOURCES OF LAW
Sources of law
The "legal formants" of a system of law are never in complete harmony. Nevertheless, the "sources of law" are usually explained to suggest that they provide a single answer to every legal problem. 
 Although the disharmony among legal formants of the system is most evident in France, the French constitution preserves the ideas of the late eighteenth century according to which legal rules can only be created by organs of government charged with legislative functions. In France, this constitution is thought to explain completely the creation of rules. Nevertheless, in France, as elsewhere, the civil law evolves incessantly, driven on by innovative judicial solutions. 
 In other European countries as well, discussions of constitutional law typically mention one or a very few of the legal formants of the system. Jurists in the fields of private law and labour law, however, are not willing to ignore "practice" which, in continental Europe, consists of systems controlled by judges and administrative organs. Some elements of the system are constitutionalized, and these are the ones the constitutional lawyers refer to in their discussions. We might refer to them as enacted
legal formants as distinguished from those which have grown up without formal enactment. Sometimes sources are recognized by speaking of a "constitution in action" or a living law and so forth. Others speak as though in an ideal legal system the only sources of law would be those indicated in the constitution, even though, in reality, many rules are created by courts, arbitrators, and administrative bodies. One can believe both in the omnipotence of the legislator and in the creative power of the judge.
Statute and judicial practices are concerned with different legal formants, which themselves may have different contents. One can affirm that the power of the legislator to make statutes without denying that judicial decisions are another source of law. To do so, one must acknowledge that judicial decisions are a source of law, whether or not they are mentioned in the constitution. Any account of the sources of law is incomplete unless it describes all legal formants of the system. 
To have a complete account, we must recognize the rules promulgated by organs of the state and enforced by its coercive power are not the only sources of law. The positivist view that law is created and enforced by the state creates a dangerous optical illusion. The organs of the state may choose to enforce rules created elsewhere. 
Law cannot be applied unless it is interpreted . When law is applied, there must be an interaction between a primary source, such as statute or precedent, and an interpretation, often provided by judges. 
Interpretation, in turn, is determined and disciplined by all those factors that affect the convictions of the interpreter. Whatever affects the convictions of the interpreter is thus a source of law as applied. In truth, legal science has not yet made the least effort to describe this phenomenon correctly.
Sacco: Problems of Translation Arising from Law
One of the main problems of comparative law is that of translating the linguistic expressions that denote legal concepts. Words do not have absolute permanent meaning. An example of problem of translation arising from law is when UNIDROIT (an international institute based in Rome founded to promote the unification of private law) started drafting an International Commercial Code in 1974 both in French and English. Article 2 of the draft dealt with "contract" and contrat, which are not the same thing. A deed transferring property or creating a mortgage and an agreement for the management of an estate by a nominee are "contrats" in
France but are not "contracts" in England or the United States where they are regarded as "conveyances" or "trusts."
Translation, then, requires the work of the jurist. To translate, one must establish the meaning of the phrase to be translated and find the right phrase to express this meaning in the language of the translation. The real difficulties of translation arise when the relationship between word and concept is not identical in different legal languages. Word and concept may be related in different ways and any theory of legal translation must consider them. 
Commercial law
History of Commercial Law
The codification of commercial law progressed throughout the 20th century in parallel with the codification of civil law. Historically, it consisted of a body of trading principles used by merchants (lex mercatoria) and applied by the courts of the corporations to their members.
Lex Mercatoria
Non-national legal systems are related to communities: one example is the “ lex mercatoria”, active from Ancient Rome to Middle Age, which regulated the trade between all merchants. Lex Mercatoria is the body of commercial law used by merchants throughout Europe during the medieval period. 
Beginning in the third century AD, banks in Persian territory began to issue letters of credit. These letters were termed “cok”, meaning “document” or “contract”. The “cok” became the “sakk” later used by traders in Arab-ruled lands. Transporting a paper “sakk” was more secure than transporting money. In the ninth
century, a merchant in one country could cash a “sakk” drawn on his bank in another country.
Italian republics
Italian municipalities and maritime republics played a vital role in shaping such legal concepts, particularly the banking industry. Merchants’ trade associations had their own special courts, which applied commercial and maritime law to settle disputes among their members and were free from any influence by local judges.
Throughout the centuries, many states created their personal commercial code.
Commercial law in US 
In the US, the push for a uniform commercial law resulted in the adoption of the h (UCC) in 1952.
The UCC provides an optional model of legislation which is drafted using the restatement technique. Despite its optional character, it was adopted across all 50 states.
Commercial law worldwide: ICC and INCOTERMS
Established in Paris in 1919, the International Commercial Chamber (ICC) was instrumental in developing and applying uniform commercial law globally. The International Commercial Terms (INCOTERMS) were first published in 1936 and have, since then, been revised time to time.
PRIVATE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW
The sources of international law
The sources of international law are: 
 International conventions, whether with a general or particular nature, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contracting states.
 International custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law.
 The general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.
Private Law
Private autonomy is the fundamental principle of private law: it states that private people can decide what to do with their rights and duties. There are just few binding rules, while the rest is left to autonomy, to the freedom of choice of people: there are some indications by the legislator for how to write a contract, how to protect your ownership, but a private may change all these rules using his private autonomy. Social rules are not binding as private law rules, but they are entrusted by the same importance.
The traditional distinction between private and public law can be explained as:
 Private law provides a legal framework for horizontal relationships between equals and freedom is its guiding principle.
 Public law governs the vertical relationship between the authoritative state and individuals or entities. The rise of public law has historically the effect of exempting the state’s authoritative power. After WWI, private law has dramatically changed and become more “social”. Such developments emerged as states were facing an increasingly severe crisis, which questioned their relationship with the legal system.
The relationship between the commercial and private law
The relationship between the commercial and private law has known different developments:
 On an international level, the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) played a very important role in developing and applying a uniform commercial law. 
 In the European context, the founding Treaties regulate the structure and powers of European institutions, laying down their principles and basis. Jurisdictions of continental Europe are generally acquainted with the fundamental distinction between private and public law, which can be understood as two complementary branches of each national law.
According to the ECJ jurisprudence, the EU Treaties apply directly not only to the Member States, but also to their citizens, thus creating rights and obligations that are likely to be protected both by national and European courts. Article 5 of TEU provides the fundamental principle of subsidiarity, according to which the EU must give priority to the legislative power of Member States , as well as to the freedom of individuals to choose which law should govern their contracts and their obligations.
EUROPEAN UNION
European Union
History
 The Treaty of Paris of 1951 created the first European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) , signed by France, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy, with Jean Monnet as its president. Its theory was simply that war would be impossibly costly if ownership and production of every country's economy were not mixed together. It was established:
o	an assembly (now the European Parliament) to represent the people, who vote it, o a Council of Ministers led by national governments, o a Commission as the executive branch, o a Court of Justice to interpret the law.
 In the Treaty of Rome of 1957, it was decided to launch the first European Economic Community (ECC). It shared the Assembly and Court with the Coal and Steel Community but set up parallel bodies for the Council and Commission. It sought to break down all barriers to trade in a common market for goods, services, labor and capital, prevent distortion of competition and regulate areas of common interest like agriculture, energy and transport. A separate treaty was signed for a European Atomic Energy Community to manage nuclear production. The Merger Treaty 1965 finally placed the ECSC and Euratom within the EEC. 
 The Treaty of Maastricht of 1992 renamed the EEC as the European Union (EU), and expanded its powers to include a social chapter, set up a European Exchange Rate Mechanism, and limit government spending. 
 A newly confident EU then sought to expand.
o	The Treaty of Nice 2001 made voting weight more proportionate to population.
o	The Euro currency went into circulation in 2002.
o	In 2005 a Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was proposed. This "Constitution" was largely symbolic but was rejected by referendums in France and the Netherlands. Most of its technical provisions were inserted into the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, without the emotive symbols of federalism or the word "constitution". 
EU law
EU law is the system of laws operating within the member states of the EU. The EU has political institutions and social and economic policies. As the European Court of Justice said, “the EU is not merely an economic union, but it represents a new legal order of international law and is intended to ensure social progress and seek the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of its peoples.”
The EU's legal foundations are the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), unanimously agreed by the governments of the 28 states that were members at the time. New states may join the EU, if they agree to operate by the rules of the organization, and existing members may leave according to their "own constitutional requirements".
The sources of EU law are divided into primary (or original) and secondary sources.
 The primary sources are about the creation of EU by member states. They are the Founding Treaties and their revisions over time.
o	Treaty on European Union TEU is the shortest of the 2 with its 55 articles. It is the legal institution which sets out the most fundamental legal properties of the EU: the aim and the objectives for which was set up, essential principles of conduct within the organization, how to leave or become a member of the union and how its constitutional rules can change. In the TEU key provisions of EU external relations are those stating the core legal principles governing all EU action, including international relations and the relationship between the
TEU and the TFEU. 
o	Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU is instead a well-defined treaty composed of 358 articles, which describe the functioning of this international organization in which the EU institutions can adopt measures in pursuit of external objectives set out in the TEU. The TFEU contains crucial provisions governing the relationship between the EU and the international law both as regards itself and its own international agreement and the legal position of the member states.  
o	The TEU and the TFEU addressed two fundamental pillars: 
 Competition
 Fundamental freedoms.
o	Since the judgement in “van Gend en Loos” case in 1963, the ECJ clarified that the Treaties are directly applicable not only to Member States, but also to their citizens, thus creating rights and obligations.
o	The Charter of Nice binds the European Union in its entirety.
o	The general principles drew by the Court of Justice drew in order to formalize some of the distinctive characteristics of European law. Thus, member states are obliged to respect these rights and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). 
 The secondary sources of EU law are conventions, regulations, directives and uniform acts:
o	Conventions: at the international level they are the most effective instrument. They are binding on their international law because, in order to become a member, they require ratification.
o	Regulations: to date, no European union regulation concerning substantive private law has been adopted. According to article 288 TFEU, a Regulation shall have general application. It is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all member states.
o	Directives: Legislative acts of the European Union. According to article 288 TFEU it shall be binding upon each member state to which it is addressed but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods. They must be implemented within a restricted period of time. An example are the directives on consumer law. 
o	Uniform acts: in the OHADA Treaty they are binding and directly applicable in the MS. An example is the Uniform Act relating to General Commercial Law (1997). In the NCCUSL Uniform acts lack the power of enforceability, resulting in a not always effective harmonization of law. States are free to choose either to adopt or to reject the exact content of the uniform act and they also can modify its content according to their interests.
The EU Parliament has repeatedly solicited the adoption of a European civil code. The Commission has also suggested that this proposal should be evaluated as a desirable option of EU legislative policy. Moreover, it was suggested that a Common Frame of Reference (CFR) should be set in order to establish common principles and language in the realm of contract law. The Draft of the CFR (DFCR) could be considered as a project of a true codification of European private law.
Van Gend en Loos and Costa v. ENEL cases: the principles of direct effect and supremacy of EU law
The claimants, the company van Gend en Loos, imported chemicals from Western Germany to the Netherlands, where they were asked to pay import taxes at Dutch customs, the defendants, which they objected to on the grounds it ran contrary to the European Economic Community’s prohibition on inter-State import duties, as per Article 12 of the Treaty of Rome (now replaced by Article 30 TFEU), which stated: Member States shall refrain from introducing between themselves any new customs duties on imports and exports or any charges having equivalent effect, and from increasing those which they already apply in their trade with each other.
The defendants contended that as the claimants were not a natural person but a legal person, they could not claim such rights. 
In 1963, when asked by a Dutch court whether national courts could apply EU law themselves, the Court of Justice replied that not only could they apply EU laws, but they were obliged to do so. This is the principle of direct effect.
Costa v. ENEL – supremacy of EU law
In 1964, an Italian court asked whether their laws nationalizing the electricity industry infringes EU law. The Court of Justice replied that, because states have decided to share some of their powers at EU level, where there is a conflict between national and EU law, the latter must prevail, and national law must be set aside.
This principle is called supremacy of EU law. 
The three main principles of EU
There are basically 3 main principles of the EU constitutional law pertinent to the external relations:
 Principle of conferral. The EU is established among the member states as high contracting parties and so they confer competences on the EU to reach objectives that they all have in common. This means that the EU has limited legal capacity to pursue objectives that can only by legally permitted by the members.
 Obligation of loyalty. The loyalty level and the unit of government must always act to ensure the proper functioning of the system of governance as a whole.
 Principle of institutional balance, in which we find a principle of balance of power. There are
7 main European institutions: European parliament, the European council, the council of minister, the European commission, the court of justice of the EU, the European central bank and the court of Auditions. The principle of balance says that these institutions can be labelled as being part of executive, legislative or judicial branch.
International agreements are the EU’s legal external relation’s tools per excellence, they create the right situation to allow the union to play along in the global legal order. We can make a distinction between instruments adopted within the EU legal order (internal) and those adopted by the Union and those adopted by the EU alone (autonomous) or agreement between the union and counter party (conventional). These instruments can be legally binding (hard law) or committing in other ways (not binding).
EU External Relationship Law
We define the EU as an international actor in abstract terms, as an entity which interacts with third countries and international organizations (and its own member states) in ways which are distinguishable from its constitutive member states. The EU is a “legal actor” since it is not a state but is subject to rules of international law on the participation of global stage. There is still a big uncertainty whether the EU is an international organization or something else. 
In its famous ruling on the Lisbon treaty, the German Constitutional court held that the Union was designed as an association of sovereign states to which sovereign powers are transferred. The EU is indeed considered special not because of its identity problems but because the high degree of “constitutional” development, supranational components and the rule of law features within this organization making it look almost like a federation of states. The EU is bound by the international law and agreements to which it is a party as well as to the customary parts of international law. So, we could consider the EU as an international organization but exclusively competent to act in certain areas, as the rule that EU Members states feel that they should give priority to the EU law in cases of a conflict with international law. 
The characteristic of this international actor is that the EU is neither a state with full international powers nor traditional international organization with limited powers to go against the will of its members; but it is based on the principle of conferred power. Conferred power means that it can only act where its member states have given it the competence to do so. Therefore, depending on the legal contest and nature of the EU’s external powers the member states have a lesser or greater degree a prominent role in the formation and the execution of international actions in the relevant area.
The Council of Europe 
Established in 1949 in Strasbourg. It has 47 member states. Its goal is to achieve a greater unity among the member states for the purpose of safeguarding and realizing the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress.
It uses Conventions and Recommendation. 
It has used more than 200 conventions, 11 about unifying law. They need to be ratified by member states. An important example is the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom in 1950.
European Court of Justice
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the supreme court of the European Union in matters of European Union law. It is part of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the main judicial branch of EU, with the European General Court.
The Court of Justice hears applications from national courts for preliminary rulings, annulment and appeals. As a part of the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal application across all EU member states under Article 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union. The European Court of Justice answers questions of European Union law following a referral from a court of a Member State. In exercising this function, it is not a court of cassation: it issues binding advice to the national courts on how EU law ought to be interpreted, it does not overturn decisions of those courts. However, the Court of Justice can act as a court of cassation when it hears appeals from the General Court of the European Union.
The General Court hears actions taken against the institutions of the European Union by individuals and member states, although certain matters are reserved for the European Court of Justice. Decisions of the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice, but only on a point of law. Prior to the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, it was known as the Court of First Instance.
COMMERCIAL LAW -> CONTRACTS
Commercial law and Contracts
There is no criterion to assess what fact is legally relevant: identifying events and behaviors that have legal consequences depends on norms in force and what they purport to regulate. 
In order to identify which events or acts of behaviour have legal consequences, we state that “ An event or act of behaviour has legal consequences if a norm establishes legal consequences to it. If a norm provides for a state of affairs, then the event or act of behaviour has legal consequence, if it does not provide a state of affair, then it does not exist for the law.”
What is a State of Affairs?
A state of affairs provided for/by a norm may consist in a single event whose occurrence triggers the established legal consequences, a simple IF-cause.
Others state of affairs consist of a whole chain of events and the relevant transaction is triggered by the occurrence of all of them.
Any event or act of behaviour which is included in the state of affairs provided by a norm is said to be legally relevant. All events or acts of behaviour that are legally relevant are classified as “ judicial facts”, they form a huge mass composed by contracts, torts, testaments, deaths, births and so on and each of them produces different legal effects.
Introduction to contracts
 Judicial facts are events connected with human action, where the will of the person is absolutely irrelevant to produce effects.  In CIVIL LAW: 
o	A juridical fact is an event that generates legal consequences, even if the person did not want it to happen. (It doesn’t count the will)
o	A good example is a car accident, after which who caused it, has to pay damages. o There is not a relevant difference with common law on this matter.
 Judicial acts are actions, declarations made by legal persons who had a certain will. They produce legal effects under the assumption they have been conscionably and voluntarily kept by a person. If the legal consequences of these acts do not take into consideration the possible will of the actor, we are talking about “juridical acts” stricto sensu. This means that anyone can decide whether or not to act a certain way, but he cannot select its legal consequences -e.g., tort- In CIVIL LAW:
o	The distinction with juridical facts was mostly developed by scholars.
o	A juridical act is the direct expression of a person's will to create legal effect.
o	A good example is a contract, that is, a voluntary agreement.
o	Civil law applies several criteria to establish whether this will existed or not.
o	They are managed differently when compared to common law.
The concept of legal transaction and its division from that of juridical act is not acknowledged by all civil law jurisdictions. A legal transaction is an act of private autonomy: it consists in someone’s declaration of will that is intended to perform a change in the rights and duties of the actor himself. Human will decides both actions and effects.
The power that this legal subject has is called private autonomy, which is broadened as far as its executive has an effect on the parties’ patrimony and not on their personality.
Judicial acts are the most important category of legal facts in private law. Among them, contracts are essential with reference to the set of rules generally applicable in legal transactions. Legal acts can be unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral; their content can be patrimonial or non-patrimonial. If a juridical act breaches a mandatory prohibition, it is void, and therefore, ineffective. Both incapacity -e.g., minors, disabled persons- and vitiating -e.g., fraud, duress- make a juridical act voidable.
The set of rights that comes with the birth of an individual is called patrimony.
The patrimony can be changed in two ways: by juridical acts and juridical facts. 
 For what concerns the former, a person can affect a change in his patrimony by an act of will which is accepted by another party’s act of will. Juridical acts can be unilateral -i.e., unaccepted acts, for example
the creation of a testament- or bilateral -e.g., conventions, which are composed of at least two unilateral acts by different parties-.
A contract is created by an offer and either the consent of a second party to receive the performance of the obligation, or the consent of the second party to receive the performance of the obligation and perform an obligation in return. The formation of a contract means that the party to whom a duty is owed has the right to enforce it in court when it is not performed as stated in the contract. This means that from the moment a contract is formed, the party under obligation is liable in the case of his default for performance by equivalent value. 
 The second way to change the patrimony is by juridical facts -e.g., the birth of a child creates rights in the child and duties in the parents-.





History
The Latin Word obligatio referred both to the right that existed on one side of the legal relationship and to the duty that existed on the other side of it. It was intended to be a bond of law. Under the ius civile, the bond of law was divided into praetorian and civil. The obligatio could arise from two main sources: contract and delict. The Institutes of Justinian stated that an obligation is made by the mere consent of the parties because there is no necessity for any writing.
In Roman Law there was no single definition of contract, rather there were four general kinds of contractual obligations: real contractual obligations, verbal contractual obligations, literal contractual obligations, and consensual contractual obligations. From these four general types we arrived at today’s contracts.
In civil law systems, contracts classification is concerned with the performance of the existing obligations: unilateral contracts do not have reciprocal obligations -e.g., gifts, options- while bilateral contracts consist in mutual obligations -e.g., sale-
A further distinction can be made between onerous contracts -i.e., when each of the parties expect to receive from the other one an advantage in exchange for the advantage that they provide- and gratious contracts i.e., when one party intends to provide an advantage to the other one without receiving any in return-. Contract is binding as a result of an exchange of consent between the parties -consensualism is the dominant principle while formalism is secondary-.
Consensualism: not sufficient to create a contract;
Formalism: includes also an element of proof.
In common law systems, the history of contract law is closely tied to the history of the writ system in England. Four writs, also called rights in action, can be identified in today’s contracts: writ of debts, writ of detinue, writ of trespass, and the writ of covenant.
During the XV Century an important concept -consideration- started being considered and became crucial to the creation of the subjective theory of contracts. 
 Objective Theory of Contract
A contract is enforceable because the parties have consented to be bound . Within this theory, the personal intents are not relevant.
 Subjective Theory of Contract 
A purely moral obligation is not sufficient for the creation of a contract because no material loss has been suffered by anyone. The subjective interpretation would have the courts settle the matter of the contract by determining what the actual, subjective, mental state of the parties was at the time of the purported formation.
 Perceptive Theory of Contract
Recently, the perceptive theory has appeared. Neither the intention of a person nor the actual declaration of a contract can be the actual essence of the contract. For this theory, it is the perceptive content that constitutes the essence of that contract. In order to apply this theory, parties need to prove their will to take part of that contract and to take all the responsibilities coming from it. That is why the perceptive theory embraces the principle of protection of legitimate expectation.
English Law has no formal definition for contract. It developed around a form of action known as the action of assumpsit: what mattered was the procedure, or the form of action, not the substance of the claim. While there is no universally agreed definition, the basic principles can be set out: to conclude a contract the parties must reach an agreement which must be supported by consideration and there must be an intention to create legal relations. The classical law of contract is based upon freedom of contract and sanctity of contract; in other words, the parties have the right to decide the terms of the contract and the courts have the duty to give effect to the agreement that the parties have reached.
Nevertheless, these two features are not the only key concepts of the law of contract. Laws have always been concerned with the fairness of the bargain and the protection of the weak. For example, children have very little contractual capacity and the courts have never allowed to enforce contracts that are illegal.
The law attempts to find a balance between the conflicting demands of freedom of contract and fairness.
These conflicting policies have been labelled “Market-individualism” and “Consumer-welfarism”.
 According to “Market-individualism”, the market is a place for competitive exchange. The function of a contract is to facilitate this competitive exchange by establishing the ground rules within which competitive commerce can be conducted. There are some keys considerations: transactions must be secure, those who enter the market need to know what the ground rules are, and finally, law should accommodate commercial practices. A persistent theme in “Market-individualism” is that judges should play a non-interventionist role with respect to contracts. The essential idea is that the “ball” is in the hands of the parties which should enter the market, choose their fellow contractors, set their own terms, strike their bargain and stick to it. We can finally state that the “Market-individualism” ideology stands for the principles of “freedom of contract” and “contract sanctity”.
 On the other hand, the “Consumer-welfarism” view stands for a policy of consumer-protection, and for principles of fairness and reasonableness in contract. It presupposes that consumer contract, and commercial contracts, should be closely regulated.
Contract Civil in Common and Civil Law
 Regarding contract law, under the Common Law the thing that matters most is the will of the parties and what they have agreed; freely and willingly; the parties under the Common Law have the liberty of form, always having in consideration principles such as good faith and the burden of disclosure during negotiations. The entire contract will be built by the parties with a minimum intervention of the law.
 In the Civil Law System all types of contracts (contract of sale, lease, donation etc.) are regulated and listed in a code. Most of the contracts have many formalities regulated by law that must be fulfilled if not the contract shall be unenforceable and invalid. In this case, the contract will be built by the parties but following the structures and regulations set by the law.
Differences of Contracts in Common and Civil Law
Civil law	Common law
It is a branch of the law of obligations	
Unilateral contracts: create a duty only for one of the parts of the contract.	Unilateral contracts: there is the manifestation of the will of one party.
Bilateral contracts: imposes a duty on both parties.	Bilateral contracts: express the will of two parties.
Doctrine of Freedom of Contracts
Freedom of contracts is a legal concept which embraces two concepts:
 The creation of a contract is the result of a free choice, unhampered by external control.
A contract, to be considered as valid, requires the presence of six main elements:
1.	The contract must have a legal purpose and cannot be used for illegal purposes.
2.	An offer must be extended. This should include the terms and conditions of the agreement.
3.	Mutual agreement between the parties.
4.	Consideration, which is when both parties agree to provide something of value in exchange for a benefit.
5.	The parties must be legally competent. Minors and impaired cannot sign a contract.
6.	All parties must come to an agreement based on their own will.
European Contract Law
In European Contract Law a distinction must be done between binding rules of contract -the manner in which these rules are applicable in a legal system depends on what is the country’s doctrine with respect to international conventions- and soft law rules -principles that can be adopted by contracting parties-.
 binding rules - there are two possible doctrines: monism -i.e., international conventions are directly applicable in national law- and dualism -i.e., international conventions must be transpose into national legislation-. 
 soft law rules - there are two main examples: The Principles of European Contract Law (PECL) and the UNIDROIT Principles.
The need of unification of Contract law in EU – the Lando commission
The Principles of European Contract Law (PECL) is a set of model rules drawn up by leading contract law academics in Europe. It attempts to provide basic rules of contract law and more generally the law of obligations, which most legal systems of the member states of the EU hold in common. The Principles of European Contract Law are based on the concept of a uniform European contract law system and were created by the self-styled Commission on European Contract Law set up by the Lando Commission. In the broader sense the PECL proposals are a "set of general rules which are designed to provide maximum flexibility and thus accommodate future development in legal thinking in the field of contract law." The PECL is a harmonizing tool, it does not represent a legally enforceable regulation: "The term 'soft law' is a blanket term for all sorts of rules, which are not enforced on behalf of the state, but are seen, for example, as goals to be achieved." The common feature of all harmonizing instruments is that they can never obtain any binding force upon their own motion. In order to gain a binding effect, a legislative act is necessary.
Another attempt: CFR and DCFR
In 2001, the European Commission issued a Communication in relation to possible developments in European contract law. Following the review of submissions on the Communication, the Commission released an Action Plan for a more coherent European contract law in 2003. The Action Plan began the process of creating what is known as the Common Frame of Reference (CFR). The CFR is intended to provide a structure and guideline for the development of harmonised European private law and has a specific focus on contract law. The studies on a possible European Civil Code have culminated in the production of the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR), a joint project of the Study Group and Acquis Group, published in December 2007, which consists of a set of rules or principles that could form the basis for the further harmonization. Nevertheless, the DCFR has a variety of controversial elements.
 CFR is the final “political” act.
 DCFR contains principles, definitions, and model rules of the European Private Law, which form the bulk of the CFR.
The unification process into a European Civil Code has several opponents; the differences among Member
States are too large. This unification process is seen as an imposition on the States - ratione imperi- rather than
an acceptance from them -imperio rationis-. In the words of Rodolfo Sacco, “reception due to pure force, however, is reversible and it will end when the force is removed”.
Numerus Clausus (closed number) Property Rights
The numerus clausus is a concept of property law which limits the number of types of right that the courts will acknowledge as having the character of "property" . The state consciously limits the activity of the parties, indicating the set of rights they can use. Several consequences follow from a right having the nature of property, as opposed to being a personal right, like a contract or obligation to pay compensation.
Historically, the law has given privileged remedies to the holders of property rights over personal claims. These have included priority in payment from an insolvent debtor, a greater likelihood of being awarded specific performance, and security in remaining in possession of land or some other asset against termination of the right to possess. It holds especial importance in land law and corporate law.
 Predetermined type: one may only use those type of property rights provided by the law.
 Predetermined content: one may only fill property rights with a content accepted by the law.
Hawking v. McGee Case
in 1929, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire decided about the Hawking v. McGee case.
After a patient injured his hand, he sought medical treatment from a doctor, the defendant. The defendant proposed surgery by using skin from plaintiff’s chest and grafting it onto patient’s injured palm, and he guaranteed that the patient could return to work a few days afterward with “a 100 percent perfect hand.” Patient’s recovery time was longer, and the palm of his hand began growing thick hair like that on his chest. Dissatisfied with the results of the operation, he sued defendant for breach of contract alleging that defendant provided a warranty that his hand would be perfect. The court first observed that the Defendant’s statements that the boy would be home from the hospital within three or four days and would be back at work a few days after did not form a contract.  Instead, this was the Defendant’s opinion or prediction.  The court, however, found that the Defendant’s statement “I will guarantee to make the hand a hundred per cent perfect hand” arguably “would establish the giving of a warranty in accordance with his contention.”  The court put credence in the fact that the Defendant repeatedly solicited the Plaintiff’s father to perform the operation in which he had little prior experience. The jury reached a verdict in patient’s favour and awarded him damages in accordance with the trial court’s instructions, namely awarding him damages for the pain from the operation and the damage the operation had caused to his hand.
In this case, the court decided according to the objective theory of law.
Herbert v. Durand Case
Herbert v. Durand case was held by the Court of Cassation in 1952 in France. It is an example of subjective theory of contract.
Durand, a tailor, got an order from Herbert to make two coats. However, once he finished his work, he realized that his wage was too law and brought the case to the labour court. The court stated that the oral agreement was contrary to public policy, since underpaying work is unethical.
In this case, instead, the court decided according to the subjective theory of law.
Vogenauer on Contract Law
The codification of general principles
The explicit and comprehensive codification of general contract law principles is a general phenomenon. 
1.	Freedom of contract,
2.	Good faith in dealing,
3.	Binding effect of contract,
4.	Freedom from form and duty to cooperate,
5.	Investigate international institutions as UNIDROIT’s PICC, PECL, DCFR.
Regarding case-law, common law judges have been suspicious of broad and sweeping pronouncements. Contrary to what one might believe, the codification of general principles of contract law is not a longstanding feature of the civil law tradition either. 
CONSUMER LAW
Twigg-Flesner on Consumer Law
Consumers are often unsure about what their rights are if they have encountered a problem, and it is not easy for them to discover these. Similarly, traders often find it difficult to understand exactly what they are required to do for the same reason, which can mean that they inadvertently fail to honour the rights their customers have. Of course, both consumers and traders can seek legal advice, but this is rarely going to provide the clarity that is needed. This complexity has been exacerbated by the adoption of consumer law in response to specific problems, combined with a similarly fragmentary evolution of consumer law at the European level. 
UK consumer law is full of problems: lack of clarity, complexity and inaccessibility are the main issues for which many consumers are unable to enforce the rights given to them. 
Usually this happens also at European level since there is a great complexity which does not enable consumers to understand which are their rights. 
The definition of consumer that can be found in EU directives is negative. From the consumer point of view there are two choices: opt-in or opt-out approach; according to the former he can choose to include some principles which bind him and the other party. With respect to the latter instead he chooses not to be bound by these principles. An example can be the CESL: indeed, we have that the CESL produced soft law instruments that can be applied by contracting parties in consumer contracts by opting-in (including them) into the contract or they can choose not to apply them and use the national domestic law in matters of contract law. The possibility to choose between these two approaches is an added value to the consumer’s protection.
It is therefore unsurprising that there have been initiatives to reform and modernise consumer law both at the domestic and European levels. In UK, at the domestic level the Draft Consumer Rights Bill was established in June 2013.
This flurry of activity at the domestic level was, in part, triggered by developments at the EU level. Over a 20year period, the EU had adopted several directives on aspects of consumer law, particularly consumer contract law. Initially, these all followed the so-called “minimum harmonisation” approach, which left Member States were free to introduce or maintain provisions in the field covered by a directive which granted consumers a higher level of protection. More recent directives shifted towards “full” or “ maximum” harmonisation, essentially removing the discretion for Member States to have more protective domestic laws in the area, and this became the stated policy of the European Commission. The academic debate both about the substantive changes to existing law and the policy shift towards full harmonization was intense, with few scholars supportive of the shift towards full harmonisation. At best, it was suggested that there could be selective, or targeted, full harmonization of a few aspects. After a turbulent progress through the legislative stages, political agreement on a Consumer Rights Directive was reached in June 2011. The final Directive leaves the directives on unfair contract terms and consumer sales untouched, and primarily standardises pre-contractual information duties and the right of withdrawal in “off-premises” and “distance” contracts. 
CONFLICT OF PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW
Private International Law
Conflict of law (sometimes called private international law) rules determine the applicability of national substantive law. This is the classical definition, which deals with conflict of laws within a State. It concerns relations across different legal jurisdictions between natural persons, companies, corporations and other legal entities, their legal obligations and the appropriate forum and procedure for resolving disputes between them. Conflict of laws especially affects private international law but may also affect domestic legal disputes e.g., determination of which state law applies in the United States, or where a contract makes incompatible reference to more than one legal framework.
As the process of globalization has advanced, to date the conflict of law rules affect cross-border relationships. Consequently, the conflict as to which possible substantive law of the legal systems involved is to be applied falls to be decided by the respective rules of private international law determining the law applicable (choice of law).
There are three levels of conflict of laws: International, European, and national (statutory/case law). The conflict of law rules adopted at these levels follow a hierarchy; if a country is bound by an International Convention, it will not apply its national conflict of law rules.
From the classical approach -i.e., conflict of law rules determines the applicability of national substantive lawanother possibility came out: applying a law other than national substantive law in cross border relationships, first considering businesses and customers.
Conventions (UNIDROIT, UNCITRAL) regulate the circumstances in which different laws must be applied; nevertheless, they are not entitled to decide upon their full applicability because countries have the final say. Taking into consideration how law instruments can be applied in cross-border relationships, 3 options are available:
-	States can replace national law with uniform substantive law (stand-in approach)
-	The parties decide which law should govern their relationship (opt-in approach)
-	Unifying substantive law is applied, unless parties decide the contrary ( opt-out approach)
The best option is the first one: a country could decide either to apply the new law at the international level or at the domestic level -e.g., CISG-.
Parties that follow the opt-in approach can determine actively the law applicable.
The Rome I Regulation preserves the parties’ right to choose the law that will govern their contract. Considering consumer transactions, only the law of the State can be applied because consumers are considered the weaker party of the contract.
Taking into consideration family law/tort law, it is more difficult to adopt harmonizing instruments because each State wants to defend the weakest party. The non-contractual obligations are regulated by Rome II Regulation.
Towards uniform private international law
There is a tendency to uniform private international law by means of treaties between nations.
 In this regard, international bodies such as the Hague Conference have played an important role by elaborating, in 2015, the “Principles of Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts ”.
 Sometimes, the convergence between legal systems has been achieved through a “ legal transplant”. According to Alan Watson, the Western legal systems as a whole would be the result of an overall legal transplant of Roman Law. 
 Since the end of the 19th century, international standardization has progressed in many areas of private law, trade and labor law. During the last century, some of the most important conventions to the uniformation of laws were drafted by UNIDROIT.
 In 1966, the UN established the UN Commission on International Trade Law ( UNCITRAL). Its greatest milestone was the Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods , which replaced two
previous treaties concluded in 1964. 
One of the most serious issues with Uniform International Legislation is its heterogeneous implementation. Therefore, the content of the uniform legislation must be implemented through national law of each contracting state; its interpretation and application have to be carried out by national courts. 
Indeed, as it is the case for the Court of Justice of the EU, the only way to ensure consistent application of uniform legislation is to remit its interpretation to an international court created for that specific purpose. 
Boele-Woelki: Conflicts
Traditionally, conflict of law rules designates only national law as the applicable law. Many unifying and harmonizing substantive law instruments of both States and non-State organizations, however, are designed specifically for application to cross-border relationships. Achieving this objective is, generally, obstacle by conflict of law rules. The requirements which non-national law need to fulfil in order to be accepted as the law governing a cross-border relationship deserve clarification. Not only uniform law, such as the CISG (Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods) and the European law, but, particularly, instruments which are aimed at harmonizing substantive law and challenge the established systems of conflict of laws. In seeking a positive approach towards the application of a law other than national law, various aspects need to be considered:
1.	is the decision taken by a court or an arbitral tribunal;
2.	what field of law (contract/delict/tort) is involved;
3.	the objective or subjective (choice by the parties) designation of the applicable law.
Unification
The international unification of law is conceived of as the process of providing identical rules for different countries so that the same solution applies everywhere . In all areas of law, the unification of the law has taken place. The unification of private law and private international law is predominantly achieved by international Conventions. The adoption of these instruments by international organizations does not per se create unified or uniform law. The Conventions merely tend to unify the law but require the legislative action by national states to be fully recognized and binding. Only after the ratification of the unifying instrument has the unification of the law been achieved.
Preferably, in the optimum situation, States would have granted to a supranational court the authority to take the final decisions in cases of different interpretations and applications of the unified rules. However, except as the European Union, such a supranational court does not exist and adjudicators are only reminded that, in the interpretation of uniform law, consideration is to be given to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its application. 
Harmonization (UNIDROIT, UNCITRAL, OHADA, EU, NCCUSL)
In contrast, the “harmonization” of the law is more likely to be achieved. Similar rules indicate that the laws of the legal systems in a specific area are in harmony with each other. The differences are reduced to a minimum. Harmonization activities by international organizations are aimed at elaborating non-binding rules which could provide models for voluntary harmonization from court decisions and legislative measures by national legislators which result in the approximation of the laws of different jurisdictions.
CISG and CESL
CISG - Convention on the International Sale of Goods
•	CISG was adopted at a UN Conference in 1980.
•	Its purpose is the global unification of the substantive law of professional international sales of moveable goods.
•	It covers the international sale of goods and excludes consumer sales. 
•	It is not concerned with the validity of the contract.
•	CISG was made to buy and sell raw materials, commodities and manufactured goods easier and cheaper in international commerce. CISG is a success since its purpose was to unify sales law on international level and it has been signed and agreed in 93 countries.
CESL- Common European Sales Law
•	CESL was drafted by the European Commission in 2011. 
•	Its purpose is to improve the conditions for the establishment and the functioning of the internal market by making available a uniform set of contract law rules.
•	It applies to cross-border transactions between a trader and a consumer and a small/medium sized enterprise (SME).
•	CESL intends to facilitate international sales by offering a further (so called “second”) sales law regime which in each Member State steps besides the existing domestic sales regime. The “second” regime is identical to all Member States: however, it is only applicable if the parties choose it.
•	CESL was proposed to make the cross-border trade less complex and costly, give consumers more choice options and make entering the market easier to businesses. 
•	In 2014 CESL was put to list of the proposals to be modified or withdrawn. In five years, it has not been discussed because of political manner: nobody wanted to let European law change in such a huge manner the national law.
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
Private international law vs. International private law 
What is UNCITRAL?
UNICTRAL was established by the general assembly of the United Nations in 1966 to promote the progressive harmonization and unification of international trade law. It utilizes conventions and model laws, focusing on dispute resolution and facilitation of international commerce . It is composed by 60 states. Its members are representatives of the world's geographic regions.
International Private Law covers comparative research based on law making for private law relationship. UNCITRAL is an example of International private law.
Purpose 
Its main purpose is to promote the harmonization and unification of international trade law and to remove unnecessary obstacles caused by inadequacies or divergences in laws affecting international trade. The techniques to achieve it are divided in three categories:
1.	Legislative: conventions, model laws and legislative guides.
2.	Contractual: texts such as The UNCITRAL Arbitration rules (1979) and The UNCITRAL Conciliation rules (1980).
3.	Explanatory: interpretative declarations.
UNIDROIT and PICC
The International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT)
UNIDROIT (formally, the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law) is an intergovernmental organization whose objective is to harmonize international private law across countries through uniform
rules, international conventions, and the production of model laws, sets of principles, guides and guidelines. Established in 1926, as at 2019 UNIDROIT has 63 member states.
UNIDROIT has prepared multiple conventions (treaties) but has also developed soft law instruments. The UNIDROIT Principles do not apply as a matter of law, but only when chosen by the parties as their contractual regime.
The Principles of International Commercial Contracts (PICC)
The Principles of International Commercial Contracts (most frequently referred to as UNIDROIT Principles and often also referred to as PICC) is a set of 211 rules for international contracts. They have been drawn up since 1984 by UNIDROIT, and they were ratified by its Council representing 64 governments of member states.
As soft law, these principles help harmonize international commercial contract law by providing rules supplementing international instruments like the CISG and even national laws. Most importantly in private practice, they offer a neutral contractual regime which the parties can choose, either by incorporation into their contracts (in whole or in parts), or by a straightforward choice of the UNIDROIT Principles.
Considerations 
The difficulty in the achievement of uniform law is not directly caused by globalization; on the contrary, globalization itself gave rise to the necessity of adopting these instruments in order to guarantee uniform and certain rules for the growing contacts among people. However, globalization travels very quickly, therefore it is challenging for institutions to keep up with these changes in terms of creation of laws and rules. The political process to produce uniform law made by countries using diplomacy can last long before a common agreement is reached. Therefore, instruments which provide open access, so to say immediate and free accessibility as PICC are preferred. Through the adoption of soft law instruments, businessmen, belonging to different legal systems and operating at an international level, can choose the PICC to rule their contract, using the private autonomy guaranteed by contract law of every jurisdiction.
OHADA
OHADA is a system of corporate law and implementing institutions adopted by seventeen West and Central African nations in 1993. The OHADA Treaty is made up today of 17 African states.
OHADA was created with the objective of fostering economic development in West and Central Africa by creating a better investment climate so as to attract investment in a 225 million-consumer market. As a West and Central African initiative to harmonize business laws and implementing institutions, OHADA aims to find alternative solutions to the lack of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The stated purpose of the initiative is to facilitate and encourage both domestic and foreign investment in the member states, and as most of the participating countries are former French colonies, they draw chiefly on a modernized French legal model to achieve their goals. The laws promulgated by OHADA are exclusively business-related.
NCCUSL and ALI
National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws NCCUSL
The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) is a non-profit unincorporated association founded in 1982. It is composed of state commissions on uniform laws appointed by each state. State commissioners are legislators, practitioners, judges, law professors and serve for specific terms without salary and are appointed by states government. The aim is to discuss and debate which areas of the law require uniformity among the states and territories and drafts acts accordingly Commissioners promote the principle of uniformity by drafting and proposing statutes, not binding, but just persuasive until states’ legislatures adopt them. The results of the discussions are proposed to the various jurisdictions. ULC
strengthens the federal system by providing rules and procedures that are consistent from state to state but also reflect the diverse experiences of states.
American Law Institute
ALI is the leading independent organization in the United States producing scholarly work to clarify, modernize, and otherwise improve the law. Its aim is «To promote the clarification and simplification of the law and its better adaptation to social needs, to secure the better administration of justice, and to encourage and carry on scholarly and scientific legal work».
List of Instruments
-	Directives: they are binding but they must be implemented by the states, which are allowed to choose the form and method
-	Model laws and model acts: they suggest a legal proposition for lawmakers and governments to consider adopting as part of their domestic law. They are not binding; they must convince imperio rationis rather than ratione imperii. countries are both free to adopt them as a whole or in part, adjusting them to their personal needs. Their flexibility makes them very attractive. 
-	Restatements: comprehensive expositions of the law in specific subjects. They are formulated like a code, but they provide more information. The provisions state the rule followed by comments which explain their role and by reporter’s notes which provide references to legal source. The ALI has published many restatements in various fields of the law, except in the one of family relationship despite the fact that it is too much different from state to state. 
-	Principles: the same technique of the restatements has been copied in drafting their Principles by
UNIDROIT and other European organizations.
UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts : The first set of principles was published by UNIDROIT when its board of directors decided to include the “unification of general principles of the law on contracts” due to an increase in international transactions. They were adopted in 1994 and modified 10 years later. They cannot become binding law since they cannot be ratified; so, they could only be considered as principles that merely provide a contribution to the harmonization of law.
to date not one single national legislator has adopted them in total; even if they had, they would only apply to B2B contracts, and their direct applicability could be questioned. 
Principles of European contract law: almost in parallel to the elaboration of the UNIDROIT principles, a similar set was being drafted, focusing only on European countries. It was drafted between 1980 and 2001 and it is based upon extensive comparative research and international cooperation. They constitute a new contract law for B2B and B2C relationships. These principles constitute the building block for many model roles. 
Principles of European Tort law: the law of the delict and tort in Europe has always been very different; as a matter of fact, until 2005, there had been no attempt to harmonize the entire field in a consistent manner. As we said, the situation changed in 2005, one of the principles of European tort law were published. They address the fundamental questions underlining every system of the law of delict and tort. 
Principles of European family law: they are drafted by the CEFL. the Divorce and Maintenance between former Spouses Principles were published in 2004; the Parental Responsibilities Principles in 2007.
American Principles on Family Dissolution:  An American restatement on family law does not exist; however, in 2000, principles of the law on family dissolution were finalized under the auspices of the ALI.
it is an enormous project -it started in the early 1900s- and it is aimed at harmonizing certain aspects of family law because the courts’ rulings differ too much, causing uncertainty. ALI Chief Reporter stated that the law that governs family law is at his stage 1 “decide as you see fit”.
